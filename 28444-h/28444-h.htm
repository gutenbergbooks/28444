<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Enter Eleanor</span></h3>
</div>
<p>A child in a faded tam-o&#8217;-shanter that had
once been baby blue, and a shoddy coat of a
glaring, unpropitious newness, was sitting uncomfortably
on the edge of a hansom seat, and gazing
soberly out at the traffic of Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>The young man beside her, a blond, sleek, narrow-headed
youth in eye-glasses, was literally
making conversation with her. That is, he was
engaged in a palpable effort to make conversation&mdash;to
manufacture out of the thin crisp air of that
November morning and the random impressions
of their progress up the Avenue, something with a
general resemblance to t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te dialogue as he
understood it. He was succeeding only indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, Eleanor,&#8221; he pointed brightly with his
stick to the flower shop they were passing, &#8220;see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
that building with the red roof, and all those
window boxes. Don&#8217;t you think those little trees
in pots outside look like Christmas trees? Sometimes
when your Aunts Beulah and Margaret
and Gertrude, whom you haven&#8217;t met yet&mdash;though
you are on your way to meet them, you know&mdash;sometimes
when they have been very good, almost
good enough to deserve it, I stop by that little
flower shop and buy a chaste half dozen of gardenias
and their accessories, and divide them among
the three.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you?&#8221; the child asked, without wistfulness.
She was a good child, David Bolling decided,&mdash;a
sporting child, willing evidently to play when it
was her turn, even when she didn&#8217;t understand the
game at all. It was certainly a new kind of game
that she would be so soon expected to play her part
in,&mdash;a rather serious kind of game, if you chose to
look at it that way.</p>
<p>David himself hardly knew how to look at it.
He was naturally a conservative young man, who
had been brought up by his mother to behave as
simply as possible on all occasions, and to avoid
the conspicuous as tacitly and tactfully as one
avoids a new disease germ. His native point of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
view, however, had been somewhat deflected by
his associations. His intimate circle consisted of
a set of people who indorsed his mother&#8217;s decalogue
only under protest, and with the most stringent
reservations. That is, they were young and
healthy, and somewhat overcharged with animal
spirits, and their reactions were all very intense
and emphatic.</p>
<p>He was trying at this instant to look rather
more as if he were likely to meet one of his own
friends than one of his mother&#8217;s. His mother&#8217;s
friends would not have understood his personal
chaperonage of the shabby little girl at his elbow.
Her hair was not even properly brushed. It looked
frazzled and tangled; and at the corner of one of
her big blue eyes, streaking diagonally across the
pallor in which it was set, was a line of dirt,&mdash;a
tear mark, it might have been, though that didn&#8217;t
make the general effect any less untidy, David
thought; only a trifle more uncomfortably pathetic.
She was a nice little girl, that fact was becoming
more and more apparent to David, but any friend
of his mother&#8217;s would have wondered, and expressed
him or herself as wondering, why in the
name of all sensitiveness he had not taken a taxicab,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
or at least something in the nature of a closed
vehicle, if he felt himself bound to deliver in person
this curious little stranger to whatever mysterious
destination she was for.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like a hansom, Eleanor, better
than a taxi-cab, because you can see more. You&#8217;ve
never been in this part of New York before, I
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You came up from Colhassett last Saturday,
didn&#8217;t you? Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel wrote to your grandmother
to send you on to us, and you took the
Saturday night boat from Fall River.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you travel alone, Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of Grandpa&#8217;s came up on the train
with me, and left me on the vessel. He told the
colored lady and gentleman to see if I was all
right,&mdash;Mr. Porter and Mrs. Steward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And were you all right?&#8221; David&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not sea sick, nor homesick?&#8221;</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s fine-featured face quivered for a
second, then set again into impassive stoic lines,
and left David wondering whether he had witnessed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
a vibration of real emotion, or the spasmodic
twitching of the muscles that is so characteristic of
the rural public school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sea sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about your grandparents, Eleanor.&#8221;
Then as she did not respond, he repeated a little
sharply, &#8220;Tell me about your grandparents, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The child still hesitated. David bowed to the wife
of a Standard Oil director in a passing limousine,
and one of the season&#8217;s prettiest d&eacute;butantes, who was
walking; and because he was only twenty-four, and
his mother was very, very ambitious for him, he
wondered if the tear smudge on the face of his companion
had been evident from the sidewalk, and
decided that it must have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to tell,&#8221; the child said at last,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you want me to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to say anything in particular,
just in general, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>David stuck. The violet eyes were widening with
misery, there was no doubt about it. &#8220;Game, clean
through,&#8221; he said to himself. Aloud he continued.
&#8220;Well, you know, Eleanor.&mdash;Never say &#8216;Well,&#8217; if
you can possibly avoid it, because it&#8217;s a flagrant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Americanism, and when you travel in foreign parts
you&#8217;re sure to regret it,&mdash;well, you know, if you are
to be in a measure my ward&mdash;and you are, my dear,
as well as the ward of your Aunts Beulah and Margaret
and Gertrude, and your Uncles Jimmie and
Peter&mdash;I ought to begin by knowing a little something
of your antecedents. That is why I suggested
that you tell me about your grandparents. I don&#8217;t
care what you tell me, but I think it would be very
suitable for you to tell me something. Are they
native Cape Codders? I&#8217;m a New Englander myself,
you know, so you may be perfectly frank with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not summer folks,&#8221; the child said. &#8220;They
just live in Colhassett all the year round. They live
in a big white house on the depot road, but they&#8217;re
so old now, they can&#8217;t keep it up. If it was painted
it would be a real pretty house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your grandparents are not very well off then?&#8221;</p>
<p>The child colored. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got lots of things,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;that Grandfather brought home when he
went to sea, but it was Uncle Amos that sent them
the money they lived on. When he died they didn&#8217;t
have any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long has he been dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago Christmas.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You must have had some money since then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since Uncle Amos died, except for the rent
of the barn, and the pasture land, and a few things
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have had money put away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; the little girl answered. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t. We
didn&#8217;t have any money, except what came in the way
I said. We sold some old-fashioned dishes, and a
little bit of cranberry bog for twenty-five dollars.
We didn&#8217;t have any other money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must have had something to live on.
You can&#8217;t make bricks without straw, or grow little
girls up without nourishing food in their tummies.&#8221;
He caught an unexpected flicker of an eyelash, and
realized for the first time that the child was acutely
aware of every word he was saying, that even his
use of English was registering a poignant impression
on her consciousness. The thought strangely embarrassed
him. &#8220;We say tummies in New York,
Eleanor,&#8221; he explained hastily. &#8220;It&#8217;s done here.
The New England stomick, however, is almost entirely
obsolete. You&#8217;ll really get on better in the
circles to which you are so soon to be accustomed if
you refer to it in my own simple fashion;&mdash;but to
return to our muttons, Eleanor, which is French for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
getting down to cases, again, you must have had
something to live on after your uncle died. You are
alive now. That would almost seem to prove my
contention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have any money, but what I earned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;what you earned. What do you mean,
Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s face turned crimson, then white again.
This time there was no mistaking the wave of sensitive
emotion that swept over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I made a dollar and a
half a week running errands, and taking care of a
sick lady vacations, and nights after school.
Grandma had that shock, and Grandpa&#8217;s back
troubled him. He tried to get work but he couldn&#8217;t.
He did all he could taking care of Grandma, and
tending the garden. They hated to have me work
out, but there was nobody else to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A family of three can&#8217;t live on a dollar and a
half a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, they can, if they manage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were your neighbors all this time,
Eleanor? You don&#8217;t mean to tell me that the good,
kindly people of Cape Cod would have stood by and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
let a little girl like you support a family alone and
unaided. It&#8217;s preposterous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The neighbors didn&#8217;t know. They thought Uncle
Amos left us something. Lots of Cape Cod children
work out. They thought that I did it because I
wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said David gravely.</p>
<p>The wheel of their cab became entangled in that
of a smart delivery wagon. He watched it thoughtfully.
Then he took off his glasses, and polished
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through a glass darkly,&#8221; he explained a little
thickly. He was really a very <i>young</i> young man,
and once below the surface of what he was pleased
to believe a very worldly and cynical manner, he had
a profound depth of tenderness and human
sympathy.</p>
<p>Then as they jogged on through the Fifty-ninth
Street end of the Park, looking strangely seared and
bereft from the first blight of the frost, he turned to
her again. This time his tone was as serious as
her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you stop working out, Eleanor?&#8221; he
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The lady I was tending died. There wasn&#8217;t nobody
else who wanted me. Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel was a
relation of hers, and when she came to the funeral,
I told her that I wanted to get work in New York
if I could,&mdash;and then last week she wrote me that
the best she could do was to get me this place to be
adopted, and so&mdash;I came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your grandparents?&#8221; David asked, and realized
almost as he spoke that he had his finger on
the spring of the tragedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They had to take help from the town.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child made a brave struggle with her tears,
and David looked away quickly. He knew something
of the temper of the steel of the New England
nature; the fierce and terrible pride that is bred in
the bone of the race. He knew that the child before
him had tasted of the bitter waters of humiliation in
seeing her kindred &#8220;helped&#8221; by the town. &#8220;Going
out to work,&#8221; he understood, had brought the family
pride low, but taking help from the town had leveled
it to the dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is, you know, a small salary that goes with
this being adopted business,&#8221; he remarked casually
a few seconds later. &#8220;Your Aunts Gertrude and
Beulah and Margaret, and your three stalwart uncles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
aforesaid, are not the kind of people who have been
brought up to expect something for nothing. They
don&#8217;t expect to adopt a perfectly good orphan without
money and without price, merely for the privilege
of experimentation. No, indeed, an orphan in
good standing of the best New England extraction
ought to exact for her services a salary of at least
fifteen dollars a month. I wouldn&#8217;t consent to take
a cent less, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; the child asked uncertainly. She
sat suddenly erect, as if an actual burden had been
dropped from her shoulders. Her eyes were not
violet, David decided, he had been deceived by the
depth of their coloring; they were blue, Mediterranean
blue, and her lashes were an inch and a half
long at the very least. She was not only pretty, she
was going to be beautiful some day. A strange premonition
struck David of a future in which this
long-lashed, stoic baby was in some way inextricably
bound.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221; he asked her abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years old day before yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had been making their way through the
Park; the searer, yellower Park of late November.
It looked duller and more cheerless than David ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
remembered it. The leaves rattled on the trees, and
the sun went down suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Central Park,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the spring
it&#8217;s very beautiful here, and all the people you know
go motoring or driving in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed to his mother&#8217;s milliner in a little
French runabout. The Frenchman stared frankly
at the baby blue tam-o&#8217;-shanter and the tangled
golden head it surmounted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joseph could make you a peachy tam-o&#8217;-shanter
looking thing of blue velvet; I&#8217;ll bet I could draw
him a picture to copy. Your Uncle David, you
know, is an artist of a sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time since their incongruous association
began the child met his smile; her face relaxed
ever so little, and the lips quivered, but she smiled
a shy, little dawning smile. There was trust in it
and confidence. David put out his hand to pat hers,
but thought better of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;my mother knows our only
living Ex-president, and the Countess of Warwick,
one Vanderbilt, two Astors, and she&#8217;s met Sir Gilbert
Parker, and Rudyard Kipling. She also knows
many of the stars and satellites of upper Fifth
Avenue. She has, as well, family connections of so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
much weight and stolidity that their very approach,
singly or in conjunction, shakes the earth underneath
them.&mdash;I wish we could meet them all,
Eleanor, every blessed one of them.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Cooperative Parents</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how a place like this apartment
will look to her,&#8221; Beulah said thoughtfully.
&#8220;I wonder if it will seem elegant, or cramped to
death. I wonder if she will take to it kindly, or
with an ill concealed contempt for its limitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor little thing will probably be so frightened
and homesick by the time David gets her here,
that she won&#8217;t know what kind of a place she&#8217;s
arrived at,&#8221; Gertrude suggested. &#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t
be in your shoes for the next few days for anything
in the world, Beulah Page; would you, Margaret?&#8221;</p>
<p>The third girl in the group smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said thoughtfully. &#8220;It would
be rather fun to begin it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have her for the first two months, and
get it over with,&#8221; Beulah said decisively. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be
hanging over your head long after my ordeal is over,
and by the time I have to have her again she&#8217;ll be
absolutely in training. You don&#8217;t come until the
fifth on the list you know, Gertrude. Jimmie has
her after me, then Margaret, then Peter, and you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
and David, if he has got up the courage to tell his
mother by that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Gertrude suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can work it out for himself. He&#8217;s got to take
the child two months like the rest of us. He&#8217;s
agreed to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will,&#8221; Margaret said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never known him
to go back on his word yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust Margaret to stick up for David. Anyway,
I&#8217;ve taken the precaution to put it in writing, as you
know, and the document is filed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not adopting this infant legally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Gertrude, we can&#8217;t,&mdash;yet, but morally we are.
She isn&#8217;t an infant, she&#8217;s ten years old. I wish you
girls would take the matter a little more seriously.
We&#8217;ve bound ourselves to be responsible for this
child&#8217;s whole future. We have undertaken her
moral, social and religious education. Her body and
soul are to be&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Equally divided among us,&#8221; Gertrude cut in.</p>
<p>Beulah scorned the interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;held sacredly in trust by the six of us, severally
and collectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t we adopted her legally then?&#8221; Margaret
asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, there are practical objections. You
have to be a corporation or an institution or something,
to adopt a child as a group. A child can&#8217;t
have three sets of parents in the eyes of the law,
especially when none of them is married, or have
the least intention of being married, to each other.&mdash;I
don&#8217;t see what you want to keep laughing at,
Gertrude. It&#8217;s all a little unusual and modern and
that sort of thing, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s funny. Do
you, Margaret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that it&#8217;s funny, but I think that it&#8217;s
serious, too, Beulah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s funny about&mdash;&#8221; Beulah began
hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s funny about anything,&mdash;even
Rogers College, do you, darling? It is funny
though for the bunch of us to undertake the upbringing
of a child ten years old; to make ourselves financially
and spiritually responsible for it. It&#8217;s a lot
more than funny, I know, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to me
as if I could go on with it at all, until somebody was
willing to admit what a <i>scream</i> the whole thing is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll admit that, if that&#8217;s all you want, won&#8217;t we,
Beulah?&#8221; Margaret appealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;ve got this insatiable sense of humor, let&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
indulge it by all means,&#8221; Gertrude laughed. &#8220;Go on,
chillun, go on, I&#8217;ll try to be good now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;Confine
yourself to a syncopated chortle while I get a
few facts out of Beulah. I did most of my
voting on this proposition by proxy, while I was
having the measles in quarantine. Beulah, did I
understand you to say you got hold of your victim
through Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel, your seamstress?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when we decided we&#8217;d do this, we thought
we&#8217;d get a child about six. We couldn&#8217;t have her
any younger, because there would be bottles, and
expert feeding, and well, you know, all those things.
We couldn&#8217;t have done it, especially the boys. We
thought six would be just about the right age, but
we simply couldn&#8217;t find a child that would do. We
had to know about its antecedents. We looked
through the orphan asylums, but there wasn&#8217;t anything
pure-blooded American that we could be sure
of. We were all agreed that we wanted pure American
blood. I knew Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel had relatives on
Cape Cod. You know what that stock is, a good
sea-faring strain, and a race of wonderfully fine
women, &#8216;atavistic aristocrats&#8217; I remember an author
in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> called them once. I suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
you think it&#8217;s funny to groan, Gertrude, when anybody
makes a literary allusion, but it isn&#8217;t. Well,
anyway, Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel knew about this child, and
sent for her. She stayed with Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel over
Sunday, and now David is bringing her here. She&#8217;ll
be here in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why David?&#8221; Gertrude twinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not David?&#8221; Beulah retorted. &#8220;It will be a
good experience for him, besides David is so amusing
when he tries to be, I thought he could divert her on
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t such a crazy idea, after all, Gertrude.&#8221;
Margaret Hutchinson was the youngest of the three,
being within several months of her majority, but she
looked older. Her face had that look of wisdom
that comes to the young who have suffered physical
pain. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do something. We&#8217;re all too
full of energy and spirits, at least the rest of you
are, and I&#8217;m getting huskier every minute, to twirl
our hands and do nothing. None of us ever wants
to be married,&mdash;that&#8217;s settled; but we do want to be
useful. We&#8217;re a united group of the closest kind of
friends, bound by the ties of&mdash;of&mdash;natural selection,
and we need a purpose in life. Gertrude&#8217;s a real
artist, but the rest of us are not, and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What could be more natural for us than to want
the living clay to work on? That&#8217;s the idea, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; Gertrude said. &#8220;I can be serious if I want to,
Beulah-land, but, honestly, girls, when I come to face
out the proposition, I&#8217;m almost afraid to. What&#8217;ll
I do with that child when it comes to be my turn?
What&#8217;ll Jimmie do? Buy her a string of pearls, and
show her the night life of New York very likely.
How&#8217;ll I break it to my mother? That&#8217;s the cheerful
little echo in my thoughts night and day. How did
you break it to yours, Beulah?&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah flushed. Her serious brown eyes, deep
brown with wine-colored lights in them, met those
of each of her friends in turn. Then she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do know this is funny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but,
you know, I haven&#8217;t dared tell her. She&#8217;ll be away
for a month, anyway. Aunt Ann is here, but I&#8217;m
only telling her that I&#8217;m having a little girl from the
country to visit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Occasionally the architect of an apartment on the
upper west side of New York&mdash;by pure accident, it
would seem, since the general run of such apartments
is so uncomfortable, and unfriendly&mdash;hits
upon a plan for a group of rooms that are at once
graciously proportioned and charmingly convenient,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
while not being an absolute offense to the eye in respect
to the details of their decoration. Beulah Page
and her mother lived in such an apartment, and they
had managed with a few ancestral household gods,
and a good many carefully related modern additions
to them, to make of their eight rooms and bath, to
say nothing of the ubiquitous butler&#8217;s-pantry, something
very remarkably resembling a home, in its
most delightful connotation: and it was in the drawing
room of this home that the three girls were gathered.</p>
<p>Beulah, the younger daughter of a widowed
mother&mdash;now visiting in the home of the elder
daughter, Beulah&#8217;s sister Agatha, in the expectation
of what the Victorians refer to as an &#8220;interesting
event&#8221;&mdash;was technically under the chaperonage of
her Aunt Ann, a solemn little spinster with no
control whatever over the movements of her determined
young niece.</p>
<p>Beulah was just out of college,&mdash;just out, in fact,
of the most high-minded of all the colleges for
women;&mdash;that founded by Andrew Rogers in the
year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixty-one.
There is probably a greater percentage of purposeful
young women graduated from Rogers College every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
year, than from any other one of the communities
of learning devoted to the education of women; and
of all the purposeful classes turned out from that
admirable institution, Beulah&#8217;s class could without
exaggeration be designated as the most purposeful
class of them all. That Beulah was not the most
purposeful member of her class merely argues that
an almost abnormally high standard of purposefulness
was maintained by practically every individual
in it.</p>
<p>At Rogers every graduating class has its fad; its
propaganda for a crusade against the most startling
evils of the world. One year, the sacred outlines of
the human figure are protected against disfigurement
by an ardent group of young classicists in Grecian
draperies. The next, a fierce young brood of vegetarians
challenge a lethargic world to mortal combat
over an Argentine sirloin. The year of Beulah&#8217;s graduation,
the new theories of child culture that were
gaining serious headway in academic circles, had
filtered into the class rooms, and Beulah&#8217;s mates had
contracted the contagion instantly. The entire senior
class went mad on the subject of child psychology
and the various scientific prescriptions for the direction
of the young idea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>It was therefore primarily to Beulah Page, that
little Eleanor Hamlin, of Colhassett, Massachusetts,
owed the change in her fortune. At least it was to
Beulah that she owed the initial inspiration that set
the wheel of that fortune in motion; but it was to the
glorious enterprise and idealism of youth, and the
courage of a set of the most intrepid and quixotic
convictions that ever quickened in the breasts of a
mad half dozen youngsters, that she owed the actual
fulfillment of her adventure.</p>
<p>The sound of the door-bell brought the three girls
to their feet, but the footfalls in the corridor, double
quick time, and accentuated, announced merely the
arrival of Jimmie Sears, and Peter Stuyvesant,
nicknamed <i>Gramercy</i> by common consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has she come?&#8221; Peter asked.</p>
<p>But Jimmie struck an attitude in the middle of the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter, oh! my daughter,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;This
suspense is killing me. For the love of Mike, children,
where is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s coming,&#8221; Beulah answered; &#8220;David&#8217;s
bringing her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gertrude pushed him into the <i>chaise-lounge</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
already in the possession of Margaret, and squeezed
in between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold my hand, Jimmie,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The feelings
of a father are nothing,&mdash;<i>nothing</i> in comparison to
those which smolder in the maternal breast. Look
at Beulah, how white she is, and Margaret is trembling
this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trembling, too,&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;or if I&#8217;m not
trembling, I&#8217;m frightened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all frightened,&#8221; Margaret said, &#8220;but we&#8217;re
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door-bell rang again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they come,&#8221; Beulah said, &#8220;oh! everybody
be good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The familiar figure of their good friend David
appeared on the threshold at this instant, and beside
him an odd-looking little figure in a shoddy cloth
coat, and a faded blue tam-o&#8217;-shanter. There was
a long smudge of dirt reaching from the corner of
her eye well down into the middle of her cheek. A
kind of composite gasp went up from the waiting
group, a gasp of surprise, consternation, and panic.
Not one of the five could have told at that instant
what it was he expected to see, or how his imagination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
of the child differed from the concrete reality,
but amazement and keen disappointment constrained
them. Here was no figure of romance and delight.
No miniature Galatea half hewn out of the block
of humanity, waiting for the chisel of a composite
Pygmalion. Here was only a grubby, little unkempt
child, like all other children, but not so presentable.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with everybody?&#8221; said David
with unnatural sharpness. &#8220;I want to present you to
our ward, Miss Eleanor Hamlin, who has come a
long way for the pleasure of meeting you. Eleanor,
these are your cooperative parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s set gaze followed his gesture obediently.
David took the little hand in his, and led
the owner into the heart of the group. Beulah
stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your Aunt Beulah, Eleanor, of whom I&#8217;ve
been telling you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to make your acquaintance, Aunt
Beulah,&#8221; the little girl said, as Beulah put out her
hand, still uncertainly.</p>
<p>Then the five saw a strange thing happen. The
immaculate, inscrutable David&mdash;the aristocrat of
aristocrats, the one undemonstrative, super-self-conscious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
member of the crowd, who had been delegated
to transport the little orphan chiefly because the
errand was so incongruous a mission on which to
despatch him&mdash;David put his arm around the neck of
the child with a quick protecting gesture, and then
gathered her close in his arms, where she clung,
quivering and sobbing, the unkempt curls straggling
helplessly over his shoulder.</p>
<p>He strode across the room where Margaret was
still sitting upright in the <i>chaise-lounge</i>, her dove-gray
eyes wide, her lips parted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you take her,&#8221; he said, without ceremony,
and slipped his burden into her arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to our city, Kiddo,&#8221; Jimmie said in his
throat, but nobody heard him.</p>
<p>Peter, whose habit it was to walk up and down
endlessly wherever he felt most at home, paused in
his peregrination, as Margaret shyly gathered the
rough little head to her bosom. The child met his
gaze as he did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t quite up to scratch,&#8221; he said gravely.</p>
<p>Beulah&#8217;s eyes filled. &#8220;Peter,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Peter, I
didn&#8217;t mean to be&mdash;not to be&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Peter seemed not to know she was speaking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
The child&#8217;s eyes still held him, and he stood gazing
down at her, his handsome head thrown slightly
back; his face deeply intent; his eyes softened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your Uncle Peter, Eleanor,&#8221; he said, and
bent down till his lips touched her forehead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Experiment Begins</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Eleanor walked over to the steam pipes,
and examined them carefully. The terrible
rattling noise had stopped, as had also the choking
and gurgling that had kept her awake because it
was so like the noise that Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel&#8217;s aunt,
the sick lady she had helped to take care of,
made constantly for the last two weeks of
her life. Whenever there was a sound that
was anything like that, Eleanor could not help
shivering. She had never seen steam pipes before.
When Beulah had shown her the room where she
was to sleep&mdash;a room all in blue, baby blue, and
pink roses&mdash;Eleanor thought that the silver pipes
standing upright in the corner were a part of some
musical instrument, like a pipe organ. When the
rattling sound had begun she thought that some one
had come into the room with her, and was tuning it.
She had drawn the pink silk puff closely about her
ears, and tried not to be frightened. Trying not to
be frightened was the way she had spent a good deal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
of her time since her Uncle Amos died, and she had
had to look out for her grandparents.</p>
<p>Now that it was morning, and the bright sun was
streaming into the windows, she ventured to climb
out of bed and approach the uncanny instrument.
She tripped on the trailing folds of that nightgown
her Aunt Beulah&mdash;it was funny that all these ladies
should call themselves her aunts, when they were
really no relation to her&mdash;had insisted on her wearing.
Her own nightdress had been left in the time-worn
carpetbag that Uncle David had forgotten to
take out of the &#8220;handsome cab.&#8221; She stumbled
against the silver pipes. They were <i>hot</i>; so hot that
the flesh of her arm nearly blistered, but she did not
cry out. Here was another mysterious problem of
the kind that New York presented at every turn, to
be silently accepted, and dealt with.</p>
<p>Her mother and father had once lived in New
York. Her father had been born here, in a house
with a brownstone front on West Tenth Street,
wherever that was. She herself had lived in New
York when she was a baby, though she had been
born in her grandfather&#8217;s house in Colhassett. She
had lived in Cincinnati, Ohio, too, until she was four
years old, and her father and mother had died there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
both in the same week, of pneumonia. She wished
this morning, that she could remember the house
where they lived in New York, and the things that
were in it.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door. Ought she to go
and open the door in her nightdress? Ought she to
call out &#8220;Come in?&#8221; It might be a gentleman, and
her Aunt Beulah&#8217;s nightdress was not very thick.
She decided to cough, so that whoever was outside
might understand she was in there, and had heard
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come in, Eleanor?&#8221; Beulah&#8217;s voice called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; She started to get into bed, but
Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;the nearer she was to her, the harder
it was to call her aunt,&mdash;Aunt Beulah might think it
was time she was up. She compromised by sitting
down in a chair.</p>
<p>Beulah had passed a practically sleepless night
working out the theory of Eleanor&#8217;s development.
The six had agreed on a certain sketchily defined
method of procedure. That is, they were to read
certain books indicated by Beulah, and to follow the
general schedule that she was to work out and adapt
to the individual needs of the child herself, during
the first phase of the experiment. She felt that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
had managed the reception badly, that she had not
done or said the right thing. Peter&#8217;s attitude had
shown that he felt the situation had been clumsily
handled, and it was she who was responsible for it.
Peter was too kind to criticize her, but she had vowed
in the muffled depths of a feverish pillow that there
should be no more flagrant flaws in the conduct of
the campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you sleep well, Eleanor?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hungry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation languished at this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you had your bath?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know I was to have one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice little girls have a bath every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they?&#8221; Eleanor asked. Her Aunt Beulah
seemed to expect her to say something more, but she
couldn&#8217;t think of anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll draw your bath for you this morning. After
this you will be expected to take it yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor had seen bathrooms before, but she had
never been in a bath-tub. At her grandfather&#8217;s, she
had taken her Saturday night baths in an old wooden
wash-tub, which had water poured in it from the tea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
kettle. When Beulah closed the door on her she
stepped gingerly into the tub: the water was twice
too hot, but she didn&#8217;t know how to turn the faucet,
or whether she was expected to turn it. Mrs.
O&#8217;Farrel had told her that people had to pay for
water in New York. Perhaps Aunt Beulah had
drawn all the water she could have. She used the
soap sparingly. Soap was expensive, she knew. She
wished there was some way of discovering just how
much of things she was expected to use. The number
of towels distressed her, but she finally took the
littlest and dried herself. The heat of the water had
nearly parboiled her.</p>
<p>After that, she tried to do blindly what she was
told. There was a girl in a black dress and white
apron that passed her everything she had to eat. Her
Aunt Beulah told her to help herself to sugar and to
cream for her oatmeal, from off this girl&#8217;s tray. Her
hand trembled a good deal, but she was fortunate
enough not to spill any. After breakfast she was
sent to wash her hands in the bathroom; she turned
the faucet, and used a very little water. Then, when
she was called, she went into the sitting-room and
sat down, and folded her hands in her lap.</p>
<p>Beulah looked at her with some perplexity. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
child was docile and willing, but she seemed unexpectedly
stupid for a girl ten years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been examined for adenoids,
Eleanor?&#8221; she asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, &#8216;no, Aunt Beulah.&#8217; Don&#8217;t say, &#8216;no, ma&#8217;am&#8217;
and &#8216;yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8217; People don&#8217;t say &#8216;no, ma&#8217;am&#8217; and
&#8216;yes, ma&#8217;am&#8217; any more, you know. They say &#8216;no&#8217; and
&#8216;yes,&#8217; and then mention the name of the person to
whom they are speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Eleanor couldn&#8217;t stop herself saying
it. She wanted to correct herself. &#8220;No, Aunt
Beulah, no, Aunt Beulah,&#8221; but the words stuck in
her throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, try to remember,&#8221; Beulah said. She was
thinking of the case in a book of psychology that she
had been reading that morning, of a girl who was
&#8220;pale and sleepy looking, expressionless of face,
careless of her personal appearance,&#8221; who after an
operation for adenoids, had become &#8220;as animated
and bright as before she had been lethargic and dull.&#8221;
She was pleased to see that Eleanor&#8217;s fine hair had
been scrupulously combed, and neatly braided this
morning, not being able to realize&mdash;as how should
she?&mdash;that the condition of Eleanor&#8217;s fine spun locks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
on her arrival the night before, had been attributable
to the fact that the O&#8217;Farrel baby had stolen her
comb, and Eleanor had been too shy to mention the
fact, and had combed her hair mermaid-wise,
through her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This morning,&#8221; Beulah began brightly, &#8220;I am
going to turn you loose in the apartment, and let
you do what you like. I want to get an idea of the
things you do like, you know. You can sew, or read,
or drum on the piano, or talk to me, anything that
pleases you most. I want you to be happy, that&#8217;s all,
and to enjoy yourself in your own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give the child absolute freedom in which to
demonstrate the worth and value of its ego,&#8221;&mdash;that
was what she was doing, &#8220;keeping it carefully under
observation while you determine the individual trend
along which to guide its development.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little girl looked about her helplessly. The
room was very large and bright. The walls were
white, and so was the woodwork, the mantle, and
some of the furniture. Gay figured curtains hung
at the windows, and there were little stools, and
chairs, and even trays with glass over them, covered
with the same bright colored material. Eleanor had
never seen a room anything like it. There was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
center-table, no crayon portraits of different members
of the family, no easels, or scarves thrown over
the corners of the pictures. There were not many
pictures, and those that there were didn&#8217;t seem to
Eleanor like pictures at all, they were all so blurry
and smudgy,&mdash;excepting one of a beautiful lady. She
would have liked to have asked the name of that
lady,&mdash;but her Aunt Beulah&#8217;s eyes were upon her.
She slipped down from her chair and walked across
the room to the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dear, what would make this the happiest
day you can think of?&#8221; Beulah asked, in the tone
she was given to use when she asked Gertrude
and Margaret and Jimmie&mdash;but not often Peter&mdash;what
they expected to do with their lives.</p>
<p>Eleanor turned a desperate face from the window,
from the row of bland elegant apartment
buildings she had been contemplating with unseeing
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to?&#8221; she asked Beulah piteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to amuse myself in my own way? I
don&#8217;t know what you want me to do. I don&#8217;t know
what you think that I ought to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>A strong-minded and spoiled younger daughter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
of a widowed mother&mdash;whose chief anxiety had
been to anticipate the wants of her children before
they were expressed&mdash;with an independent income,
and a beloved and admiring circle of intimate
friends, is not likely to be imaginatively equipped
to explore the spiritual fastnesses of a sensitive
and alien orphan. Beulah tried earnestly to get
some perspective on the child&#8217;s point of view, but
she could not. The fact that she was torturing
the child would have been outside of the limits of her
comprehension. She searched her mind for some
immediate application of the methods of Madame
Montessori, and produced a lump of modeling
clay.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t really have to do anything, Eleanor,&#8221;
she said kindly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to make an
effort to please me, only to be happy yourself. Why
don&#8217;t you try and see what you can do with this
modeling clay? Just try making it up into mud
pies, or anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mud pies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the child teach himself the significance of
contour, and the use of his hands, by fashioning
the clay into rudimentary forms of beauty.&#8221; That
was the theory.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, mud pies, if you wish to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whereupon Eleanor, conscientiously and miserably,
turned out a neat half-dozen skilful, miniature
models of the New England deep dish apple-pie,
pricked and pinched to a nicety.</p>
<p>Beulah, with a vision related to the nebulous
stages of a study by Rodin, was somewhat disconcerted
with this result, but she brightened as
she thought at least she had discovered a natural
tendency in the child that she could help her
develop.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like to cook, Eleanor?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>In the child&#8217;s mind there rose the picture of her
grim apprenticeship on Cape Cod. She could see
the querulous invalid in the sick chair, her face
distorted with pain and impatience; she could feel
the sticky dough in her fingers, and the heat from
the stove rising round her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate cooking,&#8221; she said, with the first hint of
passion she had shown in her relation to her new
friends.</p>
<p>The day dragged on wearily. Beulah took her
to walk on the Drive, but as far as she was able
to determine the child saw nothing of her surroundings.
The crowds of trimly dressed people,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the nursemaids and babies, the swift slim outlines
of the whizzing motors, even the battleships lying
so suggestively quiescent on the river before them&mdash;all
the spectacular, vivid panorama of afternoon
on Riverside Drive&mdash;seemed absolutely without interest
or savor to the child. Beulah&#8217;s despair and
chagrin were increasing almost as rapidly as
Eleanor&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon Beulah suggested a nap.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll sit here and read for a few minutes,&#8221; she
said, as she tucked Eleanor under the covers. Then,
since she was quite desperate for subjects of conversation,
and still determined by the hot memory
of her night&#8217;s vigil to leave no stone of geniality
unturned, she added:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a book that I am reading to help me
to know how to guide and educate you. I haven&#8217;t
had much experience in adopting children, you
know, Eleanor, and when there is anything in this
world that you don&#8217;t know, there is usually some
good and useful book that will help you to find out
all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even to herself her words sounded hatefully
patronizing and pedagogic, but she was past the
point of believing that she could handle the situation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
with grace. When Eleanor&#8217;s breath seemed to
be coming regularly, she put down her book with
some thankfulness and escaped to the tea table,
where she poured tea for her aunt, and explained
the child&#8217;s idiosyncrasies swiftly and smoothly to
that estimable lady.</p>
<p>Left alone, Eleanor lay still for a while, staring
at the design of pink roses on the blue wall-paper.
On Cape Cod, pink and blue were not considered
to be colors that could be combined. There was
nothing at all in New York like anything she knew
or remembered. She sighed. Then she made her
way to the window and picked up the book Beulah
had been reading. It was about <i>her</i>, Aunt Beulah
had said,&mdash;directions for educating her and training
her. The paragraph that caught her eye where
the book was open had been marked with a pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;This girl had such a fat, frog like expression
of face,&#8221; Eleanor read, &#8220;that her neighbors thought
her an idiot. She was found to be the victim of a
severe case of ad-e-noids.&#8221; As she spelled out the
word, she recognized it as the one Beulah had
used earlier in the day. She remembered the sudden
sharp look with which the question had been
accompanied. The sick lady for whom she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
&#8220;worked out&#8221; had often called her an idiot when
her feet had stumbled, or she had failed to understand
at once what was required of her.</p>
<p>Eleanor read on. She encountered a text replete
with hideous examples of backward and deficient
children, victims of adenoids who had been
restored to a state of normality by the removal
of the affliction. She had no idea what an adenoid
was. She had a hazy notion that it was a kind of
superfluous bone in the region of the breast, but
her anguish was rooted in the fact that this, <i>this</i>
was the good and useful book that her Aunt Beulah
had found it necessary to resort to for guidance, in
the case of her own&mdash;Eleanor&#8217;s&mdash;education.</p>
<p>When Beulah, refreshed by a cup of tea and
further sustained by the fact that Margaret and
Peter had both telephoned they were coming to
dinner, returned to her charge, she found the stolid,
apathetic child she had left, sprawling face downward
on the floor, in a passion of convulsive
weeping.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Peter Elucidates</span></h3>
</div>
<p>It was Peter who got at the heart of the trouble.
Margaret tried, but though Eleanor clung
to her and relaxed under the balm of her gentle
caresses, the child remained entirely inarticulate
until Peter gathered her up in his arms, and signed
to the others that he wished to be left alone
with her.</p>
<p>By the time he rejoined the two in the drawing-room&mdash;he
had missed his after-dinner coffee in
the long half-hour that he had spent shut into the
guest room with the child&mdash;Jimmie and Gertrude
had arrived, and the four sat grouped together to
await his pronouncement.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thinks she has adenoids. She wants the
doll that David left in that carpetbag of hers he
forgot to take out of the &#8216;Handsome cab.&#8217; She
wants to be loved, and she wants to grow up and
write poetry for the newspapers,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Also she will eat a piece of bread and butter and
a glass of milk, as soon as it can conveniently be
provided for her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When did you take holy orders, Gram?&#8221; Jimmie
inquired. &#8220;How do you work the confessional?
I wish I could make anybody give anything
up to me, but I can&#8217;t. Did you just go into
that darkened chamber and say to the kid, &#8216;Child
of my adoption,&mdash;cough,&#8217; and she coughed, or are
you the master of some subtler system of choking
the truth out of &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody would tell anything to Peter if he
happened to want to know it,&#8221; Margaret said seriously.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t they, Beulah?&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah nodded. &#8220;She wants to be loved,&#8221; Peter
had said. It was so simple for some people to
open their hearts and give out love,&mdash;easily, lightly.
She was not made like that,&mdash;loving came hard
with her, but when once she had given herself, it
was done. Peter didn&#8217;t know how hard she had
tried to do right with the child that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doll is called the rabbit doll, though there
is no reason why it should be, as it only looks
the least tiny bit like a rabbit, and is a girl. Its
other name is Gwendolyn, and it always goes to
bed with her. Mrs. O&#8217;Farrels aunt said that children
always stopped playing with dolls when they
got to be as big as Eleanor, but she isn&#8217;t never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
going to stop.&mdash;You must get after that double
negative, Beulah.&mdash;She once wrote a poem beginning:
&#8216;The rabbit doll, it is my own.&#8217; She thinks
that she has a frog-like expression of face, and that
is why Beulah doesn&#8217;t like her better. She is perfectly
willing to have her adenoids cut out, if Beulah
thinks it would improve her, but she doesn&#8217;t want
to &#8216;take anything,&#8217; when she has it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a wonder, Gram,&#8221; Gertrude said admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I have made a mess of it, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;
Beulah said. &#8220;Is she homesick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s homesick,&#8221; Peter said gravely, &#8220;but
not for anything she&#8217;s left in Colhassett. David
told you the story, didn&#8217;t he?&mdash;She is homesick for
her own kind, for people she can really love, and
she&#8217;s never found any of them. Her grandfather
and grandmother are old and decrepit. She feels
a terrible responsibility for them, but she doesn&#8217;t
love them, not really. She&#8217;s too hungry to love
anybody until she finds the friends she can cling
to&mdash;without compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An emotional aristocrat,&#8221; Gertrude murmured.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the curse of taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help! Help!&#8221; Jimmie cried, grimacing at Gertrude.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she have any kids her own age
to play with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had &#8217;em, but she didn&#8217;t have any time to
play with them. You forget she was supporting a
family all the time, Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By jove, I&#8217;d like to forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had one friend named Albertina Weston
that she used to run around with in school. Albertina
also wrote poetry. They used to do poetic
&#8216;stunts&#8217; of one poem a day on some subject selected
by Albertina. I think Albertina was a snob.
She candidly admitted to Eleanor that if her clothes
were more stylish, she would go round with her
more. Eleanor seemed to think that was perfectly
natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do it, Peter?&#8221; Jimmie besought.
&#8220;If I could get one damsel, no matter how tender
her years, to confide in me like that I&#8217;d be happy
for life. It&#8217;s nothing to you with those eyes, and
that matin&eacute;e forehead of yours; but I want &#8217;em
to weep down my neck, and I can&#8217;t make &#8217;em
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you grow up, Jimmie, and then see
what happens,&#8221; Gertrude soothed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till it&#8217;s your turn with our child,&#8221; Margaret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
said. &#8220;In two months more she&#8217;s coming
to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I ever forget it for a minute?&#8221; Jimmie
cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;The point of the whole business is,&#8221; Peter continued,
&#8220;that we&#8217;ve got a human soul on our hands.
We imported a kind of scientific plaything to exercise
our spiritual muscle on, and we&#8217;ve got a real
specimen of womanhood in embryo. I don&#8217;t know
whether the situation appalls you as much as it
does me&mdash;&#8221; He broke off as he heard the bell
ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s David, he said he was coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then as David appeared laden with the lost
carpetbag and a huge box of chocolates, he waved
him to a chair, and took up his speech again. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know whether the situation appalls you, as
much as it does me&mdash;if I don&#8217;t get this off my
chest now, David, I can&#8217;t do it at all&mdash;but the
thought of that poor little waif in there and the
struggle she&#8217;s had, and the shy valiant spirit of
her,&mdash;the sand that she&#8217;s got, the <i>sand</i> that put her
through and kept her mouth shut through experiences
that might easily have killed her, why I feel
as if I&#8217;d give anything I had in the world to make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
it up to her, and yet I&#8217;m not altogether sure that
I could&mdash;that we could&mdash;that it&#8217;s any of our business
to try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody else who will, if we don&#8217;t,&#8221;
David said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never known any
one of our bunch to quit anything that they once
started in on, but just by way of formality there
is one thing we ought to do about this proposition
before we slide into it any further, and that is to
agree that we want to go on with it, that we know
what we&#8217;re in for, and that we&#8217;re game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided all that before we sent for the
kid,&#8221; Jimmie said, &#8220;didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided we&#8217;d adopt a child, but we didn&#8217;t
decide we&#8217;d adopt this one. Taking the responsibility
of this one is the question before the house
just at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea being,&#8221; David added, &#8220;that she&#8217;s a
fairly delicate piece of work, and as time advances
she&#8217;s going to be <i>delicater</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that it&#8217;s an awkward matter to play with
souls,&#8221; Beulah contributed; whereupon Jimmie
murmured, &#8220;Browning,&#8221; sotto voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may be all that you say, Gram,&#8221; Jimmie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
said, after a few minutes of silence, &#8220;a thunderingly
refined and high-minded young waif, but you
will admit that without an interpreter of the same
class, she hasn&#8217;t been much good to us so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good lord, she isn&#8217;t refined and high-minded,&#8221;
Peter said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not the idea. She&#8217;s simply
supremely sensitive and full of the most pathetic
possibilities. If we&#8217;re going to undertake her we
ought to realize fully what we&#8217;re up against, and
acknowledge it,&mdash;that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m trying to say, and
I apologize for assuming that it&#8217;s more my business
than anybody&#8217;s to say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That charming humility stuff, if I could only
remember to pull it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sofa pillow that Gertrude aimed at Jimmie
hit him full on the mouth and he busied himself
pretending to eat it. Beulah scorned the interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we&#8217;re going to undertake her,&#8221;
Beulah said. &#8220;We are signed up and it&#8217;s all down
in writing. If anybody has any objections, they
can state them now.&#8221; She looked about her dramatically.
On every young face was reflected the
same earnestness that set gravely on her own.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;ayes&#8217; have it,&#8221; Jimmie murmured. &#8220;From
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
now on I become not only a parent, but a soul
doctor.&#8221; He rose, and tiptoed solemnly toward
the door of Eleanor&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Jimmie?&#8221; Beulah called,
as he was disappearing around the bend in the
corridor.</p>
<p>He turned back to lift an admonitory finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shush,&#8221; he said, &#8220;do not interrupt me. I am
going to wrap baby up in a blanket and bring her
out to her mothers and fathers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Eleanor Enjoys Herself in Her Own Way</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I am in society here,&#8221; Eleanor wrote to her
friend Albertina, with a pardonable emphasis
on that phase of her new existence that would
appeal to the haughty ideals of Miss Weston, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t have to do any housework, or anything. I
sleep under a pink silk bedquilt, and I have all new
clothes. I have a new black pattern leather sailor
hat that I sopose you would laugh at. It cost
six dollars and draws the sun down to my head
but I don&#8217;t say anything. I have six aunts and
uncles all diferent names and ages but grown up.
Uncle Peter is the most elderly, he is twenty-five.
I know becase we gave him a birthday party with
a cake. I sat at the table. I wore my crape da
shine dress. You would think that was pretty,
well it is. There is a servant girl to do evry
thing even passing your food to you on a tray.
I wish you could come to visit me. I stay two
months in a place and get broghut up there. Aunt
Beulah is peculiar but nice when you know her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
She is stric and at first I thought we was not going
to get along. She thought I had adenoids and I
thought she dislikt me too much, but it turned
out not. I take lessons from her every morning
like they give at Rogers College, not like publick
school. I have to think what I want to do a good
deal and then do it. At first she turned me loose
to enjoy myself and I could not do it, but now we
have disapline which makes it all right. My speling
is weak, but uncle Peter says Stevanson could not
spel and did not care. Stevanson was the poat
who wrote the birdie with a yellow bill in the
reader. I wish you would tel me if Grandma&#8217;s
eye is worse and what about Grandfather&#8217;s rheumatism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your fond friend, Eleanor.</p>
<p>&#8220;P. S. We have a silver organ in all the rooms
to have heat in. I was afrayd of them at first.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>In the letters to her grandparents, however, the
undercurrent of anxiety about the old people, which
was a ruling motive in her life, became apparent.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Dear Grandma and Dear Grandpa,&#8221; she wrote,</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been here a weak now. I inclose my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
salary, fifteen dollars ($15.00) which I hope you
will like. I get it for doing evry thing I am told
and being adoptid besides. You can tell the silectmen
that I am rich now and can support you just
as good as Uncle Amos. I want Grandpa to buy
some heavy undershurts right of. He will get a
couff if he doesn&#8217;t do it. Tell him to rub your arm
evry night before you go to bed, Grandma, and to
have a hot soapstone for you. If you don&#8217;t have
your bed hot you will get newmonia and I can&#8217;t
come home to take care of you, becase my salary
would stop. I like New York better now that I
have lived here some. I miss seeing you around,
and Grandpa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cook cooks on a gas stove that is very
funny. I asked her how it went and she showed
me it. She is going to leve, but lucky thing the
hired girl can cook till Aunt Beulah gets a nother
cook as antyseptic as this cook. In Rogers College
they teach ladies to have their cook&#8217;s and hired
girl&#8217;s antyseptic. It is a good idear becase of
sickness. I inclose a recipete for a good cake.
You can make it sating down. You don&#8217;t have
to stir it much, and Grandpa can bring you the
things. I will write soon. I hope you are all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
right. Let me hear that you are all right. Don&#8217;t
forget to put the cat out nights. I hope she is
all right, but remember the time she stole the butter
fish. I miss you, and I miss the cat around.
Uncle David pays me my salary out of his own
pocket, because he is the richest, but I like Uncle
Peter the best. He is very handsome and we like
to talk to each other the best. Goodbye, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>But it was on the varicolored pages of a ruled
tablet&mdash;with a picture on its cover of a pink
cheeked young lady beneath a cherry tree, and
marked in large straggling letters also varicolored
&#8220;The Cherry Blossom Tablet&#8221;&mdash;that Eleanor put
down her most sacred thoughts. On the outside,
just above the cherry tree, her name was written
with a pencil that had been many times wet to get
the desired degree of blackness, &#8220;Eleanor Hamlin,
Colhassett, Massachusetts. Private Dairy,&#8221; and on
the first page was this warning in the same painstaking,
heavily shaded chirography, &#8220;This book is
sacrid, and not be trespased in or read one word of.
By order of owner. E. H.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the private diary and Gwendolyn, the
rabbit doll, and a small blue china shepherdess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
given her by Albertina, that constituted Eleanor&#8217;s
<i>lares et penates</i>. When David had finally succeeded
in tracing the ancient carpetbag in the lost and
found department of the cab company, Eleanor was
able to set up her household gods, and draw from
them that measure of strength and security inseparable
from their familiar presence. She always
slept with two of the three beloved objects, and
after Beulah had learned to understand and appreciate
the child&#8217;s need for unsupervised privacy,
she divined that the little girl was happiest when
she could devote at least an hour or two a day to the
transcribing of earnest sentences on the pink, blue
and yellow pages of the Cherry Blossom Tablet,
and the mysterious games that she played with the
rabbit doll. That these games consisted largely in
making the rabbit doll impersonate Eleanor, while
the child herself became in turn each one of the
six uncles and aunts, and exhorted the victim accordingly,
did not of course occur to Beulah. It
did occur to her that the pink, blue and yellow
pages would have made interesting reading to
Eleanor&#8217;s guardians, if they had been privileged to
read all that was chronicled there.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My aunt Beulah wears her hair to high of her
forrid.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aunt Margaret wears her hair to slic on the
sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aunt Gertrude wears her hair just about
right.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aunt Margaret is the best looking, and has
the nicest way.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aunt Gertrude is the funniest. I never laugh
at what she says, but I have trouble not to. By
thinking of Grandpa&#8217;s rheumaticks I stop myself
just in time. Aunt Beulah means all right, and
wants to do right and have everybody else the
same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle David is not handsome, but good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jimmie is not handsome, but his hair
curls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter is the most handsome man that ere
the sun shown on. That is poetry. He has beautiful
teeth, and I like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday the Wordsworth Club&mdash;that&#8217;s what
Uncle Jimmie calls us because he says we are seven&mdash;went
to the Art Museum to edjucate me in art.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Beulah wanted to take me to one room
and keep me there until I asked to come out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Uncle Jimmie wanted to show me the statures.
Uncle David said I ought to begin with the Ming
period and work down to Art Newvoo. Aunts
Gertrude and Margaret wanted to take me to the
room of the great masters. While they were talking
Uncle Peter and I went to see a picture that
made me cry. I asked him who she was. He said
that wasn&#8217;t the important thing, that the important
thing was that one man had nailed his dream. He
didn&#8217;t doubt that lots of other painters had, but
this one meant the most to him. When I cried he
said, &#8216;You&#8217;re all right, Baby. You know.&#8217; Then
he reached down and kissed me.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>As the month progressed, it seemed to Beulah
that she was making distinct progress with the
child. Since the evening when Peter had won
Eleanor&#8217;s confidence and explained her mental processes,
her task had been illumined for her. She
belonged to that class of women in whom maternity
arouses late. She had not the facile sympathy
which accepts a relationship without the endorsement
of the understanding, and she was too young
to have much toleration for that which was not
perfectly clear to her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>She had started in with high courage to demonstrate
the value of a sociological experiment.
She hoped later, though these hopes she had so
far kept to herself, to write, or at least to collaborate
with some worthy educator, on a book
which would serve as an exact guide to other philanthropically
inclined groups who might wish to
follow the example of cooperative adoption; but
the first day of actual contact with her problem
had chilled her. She had put nothing down in her
note-book. She had made no scientific progress.
There seemed to be no intellectual response in the
child.</p>
<p>Peter had set all these things right for her. He
had shown her the child&#8217;s uncompromising integrity
of spirit. The keynote of Beulah&#8217;s nature was, as
Jimmie said, that she &#8220;had to be shown.&#8221; Peter
pointed out the fact to her that Eleanor&#8217;s slogan also
was, &#8220;No compromise.&#8221; As Eleanor became more
familiar with her surroundings this spirit became
more and more evident.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could let down the hem of these dresses,
Aunt Beulah,&#8221; she said one day, looking down at
the long stretch of leg protruding from the chic
blue frock that made her look like a Boutet de
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
Monvil. &#8220;I can&#8217;t hem very good, but my stitches
don&#8217;t show much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That dress isn&#8217;t too short, dear. It&#8217;s the way
little girls always wear them. Do little girls on
Cape Cod wear them longer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Beulah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long do they wear them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Albertina,&#8221; they had reached the point of discussion
of Albertina now, and Beulah was proud
of it, &#8220;wore her dresses to her ankles, be&mdash;because
her&mdash;her legs was so fat. She said that mine was&mdash;were
getting to be fat too, and it wasn&#8217;t refined
to wear short dresses, when your legs were fat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a good many conflicting ideas of
refinement in the world, Eleanor,&#8221; Beulah said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed there are, since I came to New
York,&#8221; Eleanor answered unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Beulah&#8217;s academic spirit recognized and rejoiced
in the fact that with all her docility, Eleanor held
firmly to her preconceived notions. She continued
to wear her dresses short, but when she was not
actually on exhibition, she hid her long legs behind
every available bit of furniture or drapery.</p>
<p>The one doubt left in her mind, of the child&#8217;s
initiative and executive ability, was destined to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
dissipated by the rather heroic measures sometimes
resorted to by a superior agency taking an ironic
hand in the game of which we have been too
inhumanly sure.</p>
<p>On the fifth week of Eleanor&#8217;s stay Beulah
became a real aunt, the cook left, and her own aunt
and official chaperon, little Miss Prentis, was laid
low with an attack of inflammatory rheumatism.
Beulah&#8217;s excitement on these various counts, combined
with indiscretions in the matter of overshoes
and overfatigue, made her an easy victim to a wandering
grip germ. She opened her eyes one morning
only to shut them with a groan of pain. There
was an ache in her head and a thickening in her
chest, the significance of which she knew only too
well. She found herself unable to rise. She
lifted a hoarse voice and called for Mary, the maid,
who did not sleep in the house but was due every
morning at seven. But the gentle knock on the
door was followed by the entrance of Eleanor,
not Mary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary didn&#8217;t come, Aunt Beulah. I thought
you was&mdash;were so tired, I&#8217;d let you have your sleep
out. I heard Miss Prentis calling, and I made
her some gruel, and I got my own breakfast.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! how dreadful,&#8221; Beulah gasped in the face
of this new calamity; &#8220;and I&#8217;m really so sick. I
don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor regarded her gravely. Then she put a
professional hand on her pulse and her forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the grip,&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I have, Eleanor, and Doctor Martin&#8217;s
out of town, and won&#8217;t be back till to-morrow
when he comes to Aunt Ann. I don&#8217;t know what
we&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tend to things,&#8221; Eleanor said. &#8220;You lie
still and close your eyes, and don&#8217;t put your arms
out of bed and get chilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll have to manage somehow,&#8221; Beulah
moaned; &#8220;how, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. Give Aunt
Annie her medicine and hot water bags, and just
let me be. I&#8217;m too sick to care what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the door had closed on the child a dozen
things occurred to Beulah that might have been
done for her. She was vaguely faint for her
breakfast. Her feet were cold. She thought of
the soothing warmth of antiphlogistine when applied
to the chest. She thought of the quinine on
the shelf in the bathroom. Once more she tried
lifting her head, but she could not accomplish a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
sitting posture. She shivered as a draft from the
open window struck her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only be taken in hand this morning,&#8221;
she thought, &#8220;I know it could be broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door opened softly. Eleanor, in the cook&#8217;s
serviceable apron of gingham that would have
easily contained another child the same size, swung
the door open with one hand and held it to accommodate
the passage of the big kitchen tray,
deeply laden with a heterogeneous collection of
objects. She pulled two chairs close to the bedside
and deposited her burden upon them. Then
she removed from the tray a goblet of some
steaming fluid and offered it to Beulah.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cream of wheat gruel,&#8221; she said, and added
ingratiatingly: &#8220;It tastes nice in a tumbler.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah drank the hot decoction gratefully and
found, to her surprise, that it was deliciously made.</p>
<p>Eleanor took the glass away from her and placed
it on the tray, from which she took what looked
to Beulah like a cloth covered omelet,&mdash;at any
rate, it was a crescent shaped article slightly yellow
in tone. Eleanor tested it with a finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just about right,&#8221; she said. Then she fixed
Beulah with a stern eye. &#8220;Open your chest,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
commanded, &#8220;and show me the spot where it&#8217;s
worst. I&#8217;ve made a meal poultice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah hesitated only a second, then she obeyed
meekly. She had never seen a meal poultice before,
but the heat on her afflicted chest was grateful
to her. Antiphlogistine was only Denver mud
anyhow. Meekly, also, she took the six grains of
quinine and the weak dose of jamaica ginger and
water that she was next offered. She felt encouraged
and refreshed enough by this treatment to
display some slight curiosity when the little girl
produced a card of villainous looking safety-pins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to pin you in with these, Aunt Beulah,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and then sweat your cold out of
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, you&#8217;re not,&#8221; Beulah said; &#8220;don&#8217;t be
absurd, Eleanor. The theory of the grip is&mdash;,&#8221;
but she was addressing merely the vanishing hem
of cook&#8217;s voluminous apron.</p>
<p>The child returned almost instantly with three
objects of assorted sizes that Beulah could not
identify. From the outside they looked like red
flannel and from the way Eleanor handled them
it was evident that they also were hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I het&mdash;heated the flatirons,&#8221; Eleanor explained,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
&#8220;the way I do for Grandma, and I&#8217;m going to
spread &#8217;em around you, after you&#8217;re pinned in the
blankets, and you got to lie there till you prespire,
and prespire good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Beulah moaned, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do any
such thing. Go away, child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cured Grandma and Grandpa and Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel&#8217;s
aunt that I worked for, and I&#8217;m going to cure
you,&#8221; Eleanor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor advanced on her threateningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your arms under those covers,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;or I&#8217;ll dash a glass of cold water in your face,&#8221;&mdash;and
Beulah obeyed her.</p>
<p>Peter nodded wisely when Beulah, cured by these
summary though obsolete methods, told the story in
full detail. Gertrude had laughed until the invalid
had enveloped herself in the last few shreds of her
dignity and ordered her out of the room, and the
others had been scarcely more sympathetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that it&#8217;s funny, Peter,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
you see, I can&#8217;t help worrying about it just the
same. Of course, as soon as I was up she was
just as respectful and obedient to my slightest wish
as she ever was, but at the time, when she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
lording it over me so, she&mdash;she actually slapped
me. You never saw such a&mdash;blazingly determined
little creature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter smiled,&mdash;gently, as was Peter&#8217;s way when
any friend of his made an appeal to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Beulah,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
let it disturb you for an instant. This manifestation
had nothing to do with our experiment. Our
experiment is working fine&mdash;better than I dreamed
it would ever work. What happened to Eleanor,
you know, was simply this. Some of the conditions
of her experience were recreated suddenly,
and she reverted.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Jimmie Becomes a Parent</span></h3>
</div>
<p>The entrance into the dining-room of the curly
headed young man and his pretty little niece,
who had a suite on the eighth floor, as the room
clerk informed all inquirers, was always a matter
of interest to the residents of the Hotel Winchester.
They were an extremely picturesque pair to the
eye seeking for romance and color. The child had
the pure, clear cut features of the cameo type
of New England maidenhood. She was always
dressed in some striking combination of blue, deep
blue like her eyes, with blue hair ribbons. Her
good-looking young relative, with hair almost as
near the color of the sun as her own, seemed to be
entirely devoted to her, which, considering the
charm of the child and the radiant and magnetic
spirit of the young man himself, was a delightfully
natural manifestation.</p>
<p>But one morning near the close of the second
week of their stay, the usual radiation of resilient
youth was conspicuously absent from the young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
man&#8217;s demeanor, and the child&#8217;s face reflected the
gloom that sat so incongruously on the contour
of an optimist. The little girl fumbled her menu
card, but the waitress&mdash;the usual aging pedagogic
type of the small residential hotel&mdash;stood unnoticed
at the young man&#8217;s elbow for some minutes before
he was sufficiently aroused from his gloomy meditations
to address her. When he turned to her at
last, however, it was with the grin that she had
grown to associate with him,&mdash;the grin, the absence
of which had kept her waiting behind his
chair with a patience that she was, except in a case
where her affections were involved, entirely incapable
of. Jimmie&#8217;s protestations of inability to make
headway with the ladies were not entirely sincere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring me everything on the menu,&#8221; he said,
with a wave of his hand in the direction of that
painstaking pasteboard. &#8220;Coffee, tea, fruit, marmalade,
breakfast food, ham and eggs. Bring my
niece here the same. That&#8217;s all.&#8221; With another
wave of the hand he dismissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t eat it all, Uncle Jimmie,&#8221; Eleanor
protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a bet with you,&#8221; Jimmie declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you a dollar to a doughnut that if she
brings it all, I&#8217;ll eat it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Uncle Jimmie, you know she won&#8217;t bring
it. You never bet so I can get the dollar,&mdash;you
never do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never bet so I can get my doughnut, if it
comes to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to buy any doughnuts,&#8221;
Eleanor said; &#8220;besides, Uncle Jimmie, I don&#8217;t really
consider that I owe them. I never really say that
I&#8217;m betting, and you tell me I&#8217;ve lost before I&#8217;ve
made up my mind anything about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of doughnuts,&#8221; Jimmie said, his face
still wearing the look of dejection under a grin
worn awry, &#8220;can you cook, Eleanor? Can you
roast a steak, and saute baked beans, and stew
sausages, and fry out a breakfast muffin? Does
she look like a cook to you?&#8221; he suddenly demanded
of the waitress, who was serving him, with
an apologetic eye on the menu, the invariable
toast-coffee-and-three-minute-egg breakfast that he
had eaten every morning since his arrival.</p>
<p>The waitress smiled toothily. &#8220;She looks like a
capable one,&#8221; she pronounced.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>can</i> cook, Uncle Jimmie,&#8221; Eleanor giggled,
&#8220;but not the way you said. You don&#8217;t roast steak,
or&mdash;or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Jimmie asked with the expression
of pained surprise that never failed to make his
ward wriggle with delight. There were links in
the educational scheme that Jimmie forged better
than any of the cooperative guardians. Not even
Jimmie realized the value of the giggle as a developing
factor in Eleanor&#8217;s existence. He took
three swallows of coffee and frowned into his cup.
&#8220;I can make coffee,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Good coffee.
Well, we may as well look the facts in the face,
Eleanor. The jig&#8217;s up. We&#8217;re moving away from
this elegant hostelry to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we?&#8221; Eleanor asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Kiddo. Apologies to Aunt Beulah (mustn&#8217;t
call you Kiddo) and the reason is, that I&#8217;m broke.
I haven&#8217;t got any money at all, Eleanor, and I
don&#8217;t know where I am going to get any. You
see, it is this way. I lost my job six weeks ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you go to work every morning, Uncle
Jimmie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I leave the house, that is. I go looking for
work, but so far no nice juicy job has come rolling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
down into my lap. I haven&#8217;t told you this before
because,&mdash;well&mdash;when Aunt Beulah comes down
every day to give you your lessons I wanted it to
look all O. K. I thought if you didn&#8217;t know, you
couldn&#8217;t forget sometime and tell her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t tattle tale,&#8221; Eleanor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t, Eleanor. It&#8217;s only my doggone
pride that makes me want to keep up the
bluff, but you&#8217;re a game kid,&mdash;you&mdash;know. I tried
to get you switched off to one of the others till I
could get on my feet, but&mdash;no, they just thought
I had stage fright. I couldn&#8217;t insist. It would be
pretty humiliating to me to admit that I couldn&#8217;t
support one-sixth of a child that I&#8217;d given my
solemn oath to be-parent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To&mdash;to what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be-parent, if it isn&#8217;t a word, I invent it. It&#8217;s
awfully tough luck for you, and if you want me
to I&#8217;ll own up to the crowd that I can&#8217;t swing
you, but if you are willing to stick, why, we&#8217;ll fix
up some kind of a way to cut down expenses and
bluff it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor considered the prospect. Jimmie watched
her apparent hesitation with some dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say the word,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell &#8217;em.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t want you to tell &#8217;em,&#8221; Eleanor
cried. &#8220;I was just thinking. If you could get me
a place, you know, I could go out to work. You
don&#8217;t eat very much for a man, and I might get
my meals thrown in&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Eleanor, don&#8217;t,&#8221; Jimmie agonized. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a scheme for us all right. This&mdash;this embarrassment
is only temporary. The day will come
when I can provide you with Pol Roge and
diamonds. My father is rich, you know, but he
swore to me that I couldn&#8217;t support myself, and
I swore to him that I could, and if I don&#8217;t do it,
I&#8217;m damned. I am really, and that isn&#8217;t swearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it isn&#8217;t, when you mean it the way
they say in the Bible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the crowd to know. I don&#8217;t want
Gertrude to know. She hasn&#8217;t got much idea of me
anyway. I&#8217;ll get another job, if I can only hold
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can go to work in a store,&#8221; Eleanor cried.
&#8220;I can be one of those little girls in black dresses
that runs between counters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to break your poor Uncle James&#8217;
heart, Eleanor,&mdash;do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Uncle Jimmie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then listen to me. I&#8217;ve borrowed a studio, a
large barnlike studio on Washington Square, suitably
equipped with pots and pans and kettles.
Also, I am going to borrow the wherewithal to
keep us going. It isn&#8217;t a bad kind of place if anybody
likes it. There&#8217;s one dinky little bedroom for
you and a cot bed for me, choked in bagdad. If
you could kind of engineer the cooking end of it,
with me to do the dirty work, of course, I think
we could be quite snug and cozy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we could, Uncle Jimmie,&#8221; Eleanor said.
&#8220;Will Uncle Peter come to see us just the same?&#8221;</p>
<p>It thus befell that on the fourteenth day of the
third month of her residence in New York,
Eleanor descended into Bohemia. Having no least
suspicion of the real state of affairs&mdash;for Jimmie,
like most apparently expansive people who are
given to rattling nonsense, was actually very reticent
about his own business&mdash;the other members
of the sextette did not hesitate to show their
chagrin and disapproval at the change in his manner
of living.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Winchester was an ideal place for
Eleanor,&#8221; Beulah wailed. &#8220;It&#8217;s deadly respectable
and middle class, but it was just the kind of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
atmosphere for her to accustom herself to. She
was learning to manage herself so prettily. This
morning when I went to the studio&mdash;I wanted to
get the lessons over early, and take Eleanor to
see that exhibition of Bavarian dolls at Kuhner&#8217;s&mdash;I
found her washing up a trail of dishes in that
closet behind the screen&mdash;you&#8217;ve seen it, Gertrude?&mdash;like
some poor little scullery maid. She said
that Jimmie had made an omelet for breakfast.
If he&#8217;d made fifty omelets there couldn&#8217;t have
been a greater assortment of dirty dishes and
kettles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gertrude smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie made an omelet for me once for
which he used two dozen eggs. He kept breaking
them until he found the yolks of a color to suit
him. He said pale yolks made poor omelets, so
he threw all the pale ones away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that you sat by and let him,&#8221; Beulah
said. &#8220;You would let Jimmie do anything. You&#8217;re
as bad as Margaret is about David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or as bad as you are about Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There we go, just like any silly, brainless girls,
whose chief object in life is the&mdash;the other sex,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Beulah cried inconsistently. &#8220;Oh! I hate that
kind of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I&mdash;in theory&mdash;&#8221; Gertrude answered, a
little dreamily. &#8220;Where do Jimmie and Eleanor
get the rest of their meals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to find out,&#8221; Beulah said. &#8220;I
asked Eleanor point-blank this morning what they
had to eat last night and where they had it, and
she said, &#8216;That&#8217;s a secret, Aunt Beulah.&#8217; When I
asked her why it was a secret and who it was a
secret with, she only looked worried, and said she
guessed she wouldn&#8217;t talk about it at all because
that was the only way to be safe about tattling.
You know what I think&mdash;I think Jimmie is taking
her around to the caf&eacute;s and all the shady extravagant
restaurants. He thinks it&#8217;s sport and it
keeps him from getting bored with the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s one way of educating the young,&#8221;
Gertrude said, &#8220;but I think you are wrong,
Beulah.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>One Descent into Bohemia</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Beulah does not think that Uncle
Jimmie is bringing me up right,&#8221; Eleanor
confided to the pages of her diary. &#8220;She comes
down here and is very uncomforterble. Well he
is bringing me up good, in some ways better than
she did. When he swears he always puts out his
hand for me to slap him. He had enough to
swear of. He can&#8217;t get any work or earn wages.
The advertisement business is on the bum this year
becase times are so hard up. The advertisers
have to save their money and advertising agents
are failing right and left. So poor Uncle Jimmie
can&#8217;t get a place to work at.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people in the other studios are very neighborly.
Uncle Jimmie leaves a sine on the door
when he goes out. It says &#8216;Don&#8217;t Knock.&#8217; They
don&#8217;t they come right in and borrow things. Uncle
Jimmie says not to have much to do with them,
becase they are so queer, but when I am not at
home, the ladies come to call on him, and drink
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Moxie or something. I know becase once I
caught them. Uncle Jimmie says I shall not have
Behemiar thrust upon me by him, and to keep
away from these ladies until I grow up and then
see if I like them. Aunt Beulah thinks that Uncle
Jimmie takes me around to other studios and I
won&#8217;t tell but he does not take me anywhere
except to walk and have ice-cream soda, but
I say I don&#8217;t want it because of saving the ten
cents. We cook on an old gas stove that smells.
I can&#8217;t do very good housekeeping becase things
are not convenient. I haven&#8217;t any oven to do a
Saturday baking in, and Uncle Jimmie won&#8217;t let
me do the washing. I should feel more as if I
earned my keap if I baked beans and made boiled
dinners and layer cake, but in New York they
don&#8217;t eat much but hearty food and saluds. It
isn&#8217;t stylish to have cake and pie and pudding all
at one meal. Poor Grandpa would starve. He eats
pie for his breakfast, but if I told anybody they
would laugh. If I wrote Albertina what folks eat
in New York she would laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jimmie is teaching me to like salud. He
laughs when I cut up lettice and put sugar on it.
He teaches me to like olives and dried up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
sausages and sour crought. He says it is important
to be edjucated in eating, and everytime we go to
the Delicate Essenn store to buy something that
will edjucate me better. He teaches me to say &#8216;I
beg your pardon,&#8217; and &#8216;Polly vous Fransay?&#8217; and
to courtesy and how to enter a room the way you
do in private theatricals. He says it isn&#8217;t knowing
these things so much as knowing when you do
them that counts, and then Aunt Beulah complains
that I am not being brought up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen Uncle Peter for a weak. He
said he was going away. I miss him. I would not
have to tell him how I was being brought up, and
whether I was hitting the white lights as Uncle
Jimmie says.&mdash;He would know.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Eleanor did not write Albertina during the time
when she was living in the studio. Some curious
inversion of pride kept her silent on the subject
of the change in her life. Albertina would have
turned up her nose at the studio, Eleanor knew.
Therefore, she would not so much as address an
envelope to that young lady from an interior which
she would have beheld with scorn. She held long
conversations with Gwendolyn, taking the part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
Albertina, on the subject of this snobbishness of
attitude.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Lots of people in New York have to live in
little teny, weeny rooms, Albertina,&#8221; she would
say. &#8220;Rents are perfectly awful here. This studio
is so big I get tired dusting all the way round it,
and even if it isn&#8217;t furnished very much, why, think
how much furnishing would cost, and carpets and
gold frames for the pictures! The pictures that
are in here already, without any frames, would
sell for hundreds of dollars apiece if the painter
could get anybody to buy them. You ought to be
very thankful for such a place, Albertina, instead
of feeling so stuck up that you pick up your skirts
from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>But Albertina&#8217;s superiority of mind was impregnable.
Her spirit sat in judgment on all the
conditions of Eleanor&#8217;s new environment. She
seemed to criticize everything. She hated the
nicked, dun colored dishes they ate from, and the
black bottomed pots and pans that all the energy
of Eleanor&#8217;s energetic little elbow could not restore
to decency again. She hated the cracked, dun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
colored walls, and the mottled floor that no amount
of sweeping and dusting seemed to make an impression
on. She hated the compromise of housekeeping
in an attic,&mdash;she who had been bred in an
atmosphere of shining nickle-plated ranges and
linoleum, where even the kitchen pump gleamed
brightly under its annual coat of good green paint.
She hated the compromise, that was the burden
of her complaint&mdash;either in the person of Albertina
or Gwendolyn, whether she lay in the crook of
Eleanor&#8217;s arm in the lumpy bed where she reposed
at the end of the day&#8217;s labor, or whether
she sat bolt upright on the lumpy cot in the studio,
the broken bisque arm, which Jimmie insisted on
her wearing in a sling whenever he was present,
dangling limply at her side in the relaxation
Eleanor preferred for it.</p>
<p>The fact of not having adequate opportunity to
keep her house in order troubled the child, for
her days were zealously planned by her enthusiastic
guardians. Beulah came at ten o&#8217;clock every
morning to give her lessons. As Jimmie&#8217;s quest
for work grew into a more and more disheartening
adventure, she had difficulty in getting him out
of bed in time to prepare and clear away the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
breakfast for Beulah&#8217;s arrival. After lunch, to
which Jimmie scrupulously came home, she was
supposed to work an hour at her modeling clay.
Gertrude, who was doing very promising work at
the art league, came to the studio twice a week to
give her instruction in handling it. Later in the
afternoon one of the aunts or uncles usually appeared
with some scheme to divert her. Margaret
was telling her the stories of the Shakespeare
plays, and David was trying to make a card player
of her, but was not succeeding as well as if
Albertina had not been brought up a hard shell
Baptist, who thought card playing a device of the
devil&#8217;s. Peter alone did not come, for even when
he was in town he was busy in the afternoon.</p>
<p>As soon as her guests were gone, Eleanor hurried
through such housewifely tasks as were possible
of accomplishment at that hour, but the
strain was telling on her. Jimmie began to realize
this and it added to his own distress. One night
to save her the labor of preparing the meal, he
took her to an Italian restaurant in the neighborhood
where the food was honest and palatable,
and the service at least deft and clean.</p>
<p>Eleanor enjoyed the experience extremely, until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
an incident occurred which robbed her evening of
its sweetness and plunged her into the purgatory
of the child who has inadvertently broken one of
its own laws.</p>
<p>Among the belongings in the carpetbag, which
was no more&mdash;having been supplanted by a smart
little suit-case marked with her initials&mdash;was a
certificate from the Massachusetts Total Abstinence
Society, duly signed by herself, and witnessed by
the grammar-school teacher and the secretary of
the organization. On this certificate (which was
decorated by many presentations in dim black and
white of mid-Victorian domestic life, and surmounted
by a collection of scalloped clouds in
which drifted three amateur looking angels amid
a crowd of more professional cherubim) Eleanor
had pledged herself to abstain from the use as a
beverage of all intoxicating drinks, and from the
manufacture or traffic in them. She had also
subscribed herself as willing to make direct and
persevering efforts to extend the principles and
blessings of total abstinence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Red ink, Andrea,&#8221; her Uncle Jimmie had demanded,
as the black-eyed waiter bent over him,
&#8220;and ginger ale for the offspring.&#8221; Eleanor giggled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
It was fun to be with Uncle Jimmie in a restaurant
again. He always called for something new and
unexpected when he spoke of her to the waiter,
and he was always what Albertina would consider
&#8220;very comical&#8221; when he talked to him. &#8220;But
stay,&#8221; he added holding up an admonitory finger,
&#8220;I think we&#8217;ll give the little one <i>eau rougie</i> this
time. Wouldn&#8217;t you like <i>eau rougie</i>, tinted water,
Eleanor, the way the French children drink it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsuspectingly she sipped the mixture of water
and ice and sugar, and &#8220;red ink&#8221; from the big
brown glass bottle that the glowing waiter set
before them.</p>
<p>As the meal progressed Jimmie told her that the
grated cheese was sawdust and almost made her
believe it. He showed her how to eat spaghetti
without cutting it and pointed out to her various
Italian examples of his object lesson; but she soon
realized that in spite of his efforts to entertain her,
he was really very unhappy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve borrowed all the money I can, Angelface,&#8221;
he confessed finally. &#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s the last day of
grace. If I don&#8217;t land that job at the Perkins
agency I&#8217;ll have to give in and tell Peter and
David, or wire Dad.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You could get some other kind of a job,&#8221;
Eleanor said; &#8220;plumbing or clerking or something.&#8221;
On Cape Cod the plumber and the grocer&#8217;s
clerk lost no caste because of their calling.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>could</i> so demean myself, and I will. I&#8217;ll be
a chauffeur, I can run a car all right; but the fact
remains that by to-morrow something&#8217;s got to happen,
or I&#8217;ve got to own up to the bunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#8217;s heart sank. She tried hard to think
of something to comfort him but she could not.
Jimmie mixed her more <i>eau rougie</i> and she drank
it. He poured a full glass, undiluted, for himself,
and held it up to the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s to crime, daughter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Long
may it wave, and us with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t really red ink, is it?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s
an awfully pretty color&mdash;like grape juice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is grape juice, my child, if we don&#8217;t inquire
too closely into the matter. The Italians are like
the French in the guide book, &#8216;fond of dancing
and light wines.&#8217; This is one of the light wines
they are fond of.&mdash;Hello, do you feel sick, child?
You&#8217;re white as a ghost. It&#8217;s the air. As soon as

I can get hold of that sacrificed waiter we&#8217;ll get
out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#8217;s sickness was of the spirit, but at the
moment she was incapable of telling him so, incapable
of any sort of speech. A great wave of
faintness encompassed her. She had broken her
pledge. She had lightly encouraged a departure
from the blessings and principles of total abstinence.</p>
<p>That night in her bed she made a long and impassioned
apology to her Maker for the sin of intemperance
into which she had been so unwittingly
betrayed. She promised Him that she would never
drink anything that came out of a bottle again.
She reviewed sorrowfully her many arguments with
Albertina&mdash;Albertina in the flesh that is&mdash;on the
subject of bottled drinks in general, and decided
that again that virtuous child was right in her condemnation
of any drink, however harmless in appearance
or nomenclature, that bore the stigma of
a bottled label.</p>
<p>She knew, however, that something more than
a prayer for forgiveness was required of her. She
was pledged to protest against the evil that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
had seemingly countenanced. She could not seek
the sleep of the innocent until that reparation was
made. Through the crack of her sagging door
she saw the light from Jimmie&#8217;s reading lamp and
knew that he was still dressed, or clothed at least,
with a sufficient regard for the conventionalities
to permit her intrusion. She rose and rebraided
her hair and tied a daytime ribbon on it. Then
she put on her stockings and her blue Japanese
kimono&mdash;real Japanese, as Aunt Beulah explained,
made for a Japanese lady of quality&mdash;and made
her way into the studio.</p>
<p>Jimmie was not sitting in the one comfortable
studio chair with his book under the light and his
feet on the bamboo tea table as usual. He was not
sitting up at all. He was flung on the couch with
his face buried in the cushions, and his shoulders
were shaking. Eleanor seeing him thus, forgot
her righteous purpose, forgot her pledge to
disseminate the principles and blessings of abstinence,
forgot everything but the pitiful spectacle
of her gallant Uncle Jimmie in grief. She stood
looking down at him without quite the courage to
kneel at his side to give him comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jimmie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Uncle Jimmie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>At the sound of her voice he put out his hand
to her, gropingly, but he did not uncover his face
or shift his position. She found herself smoothing
his hair, gingerly at first, but with more and
more conviction as he snuggled his boyish head
closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully discouraged,&#8221; he said in a weak
muffled voice. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you caught me at it,
Baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor put her face down close to his as he
turned it to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything will be all right,&#8221; she promised
him, &#8220;everything will be all right. You&#8217;ll soon
get a job&mdash;tomorrow maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she gathered him close in her angular,
tense little arms and held him there tightly.
&#8220;Everything will be all right,&#8221; she repeated soothingly;
&#8220;now you just put your head here, and have
your cry out.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Ten Hutchinsons</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;My Aunt Margaret has a great many people
living in her family,&#8221; Eleanor wrote to
Albertina from her new address on Morningside
Heights. &#8220;She has a mother and a father, and two
(2) grandparents, one (1) aunt, one (1) brother,
one (1) married lady and the boy of the lady, I
think the married lady is a sister but I do not ask
any one, oh&mdash;and another brother, who does not
live here only on Saturdays and Sundays. Aunt
Margaret makes ten, and they have a man to wait
on the table. His name is a butler. I guess you
have read about them in stories. I am taken right
in to be one of the family, and I have a good time
every day now. Aunt Margaret&#8217;s father is a college
teacher, and Aunt Margaret&#8217;s grandfather
looks like the father of his country. You know
who I mean George Washington. They have a
piano here that plays itself like a sewing machine.
They let me do it. They have after-dinner coffee
and gold spoons to it. I guess you would like to see
a gold spoon. I did. They are about the size of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
the tin spoons we had in our playhouse. I have a
lot of fun with that boy too. At first I thought
he was very affected, but that is just the way they
teach him to talk. He is nine and plays tricks on
other people. He dares me to do things that I
don&#8217;t do, like go down-stairs and steal sugar. If
Aunt Margaret&#8217;s mother was my grandma I might
steal sugar or plum cake. I don&#8217;t know. Remember
the time we took your mother&#8217;s hermits? I
do. I would like to see you. You would think
this house was quite a grand house. It has three
(3) flights of stairs and one basement. I sleep
on the top floor in a dressing room out of Aunt
Margaret&#8217;s only it isn&#8217;t a dressing room. I dress
there but no one else can. Aunt Margaret is
pretty and sings lovely. Uncle David comes here
a lot. I must close. With love and kisses.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>In her diary she recorded some of the more intimate
facts of her new existence, such facts as
she instinctively guarded from Albertina&#8217;s calculating
sense.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Everybody makes fun of me here. I don&#8217;t
care if they do, but I can&#8217;t eat so much at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
table when every one is laughing at me. They get
me to talking and then they laugh. If I could
see anything to laugh at, I would laugh too. They
laugh in a refined way but they laugh. They call
me Margaret&#8217;s protegay. They are good to me
too. They say to my face that I am like a merry
wilkins story and too good to be true, and New
England projuces lots of real art, and I am art,
I can&#8217;t remember all the things, but I guess they
mean well. Aunt Margaret&#8217;s grandfather sits at
the head of the table, and talks about things I
never heard of before. He knows the govoner
and does not like the way he parts his hair. I
thought all govoners did what they wanted to
with their hairs or anything and people had to like
it because (I used to spell because wrong but I
spell better now) they was the govoners, but it
seems not at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Margaret is lovely to me. We have
good times. I meant to like Aunt Beulah the
best because she has done the most for me but I
am afrayd I don&#8217;t. I would not cross my heart
and say so. Aunt Margaret gives me the lessons
now. I guess I learn most as much as I learned
I mean was taught of Aunt Beulah. Oh dear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
sometimes I get descouraged on account of its
being such a funny world and so many diferent
people in it. And so many diferent feelings. I
was afrayd of the hired butler, but I am not now.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Eleanor had not made a direct change from the
Washington Square studio to the ample house of
the Hutchinsons, and it was as well for her that a
change in Jimmie&#8217;s fortunes had taken her back
to the Winchester and enabled her to accustom
herself again to the amenities of gentler living.
Like all sensitive and impressionable children she
took on the color of a new environment very
quickly. The strain of her studio experience had
left her a little cowed and unsure of herself, but
she had brightened up like a flower set in the cheerful
surroundings of the Winchester and under the
influence of Jimmie&#8217;s restored spirits.</p>
<p>The change had come about on Jimmie&#8217;s &#8220;last
day of grace.&#8221; He had secured the coveted position
at the Perkins agency at a slight advance
over the salary he had received at the old place.
He had left Eleanor in the morning determined to
face becomingly the disappointment that was in
store for him, and to accept the bitter necessity of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
admitting his failure to his friends. He had come
back in the late afternoon with his fortunes restored,
the long weeks of humiliation wiped out,
and his life back again on its old confident and
inspired footing.</p>
<p>He had burst into the studio with his news before
he understood that Eleanor was not alone,
and inadvertently shared the secret with Gertrude,
who had been waiting for him with the kettle
alight and some wonderful cakes from &#8220;Henri&#8217;s&#8221;
spread out on the tea table. The three had celebrated
by dining together at a festive down-town
hotel and going back to his studio for coffee. At
parting they had solemnly and severally kissed
one another. Eleanor lay awake in the dark for
a long time that night softly rubbing the cheek
that had been so caressed, and rejoicing that the
drink Uncle Jimmie had called a high-ball and had
pledged their health with so assiduously, had come
out of two glasses instead of a bottle.</p>
<p>Her life at the Hutchinsons&#8217; was almost like a
life on another planet. Margaret was the younger,
somewhat delicate daughter of a family of rather
strident academics. Professor Hutchinson was not
dependent on his salary to defray the expenses of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
his elegant establishment, but on his father, who
had inherited from his father in turn the substantial
fortune on which the family was founded.</p>
<p>Margaret was really a child of the fairies, but
she was considerably more fortunate in her choice
of a foster family than is usually the fate of the
foundling. The rigorous altitude of intellect in
which she was reared served as a corrective to the
oversensitive quality of her imagination.</p>
<p>Eleanor, who in the more leisurely moments of
her life was given to visitations from the poetic
muse, was inspired to inscribe some lines to her on
one of the pink pages of the private diary. They
ran as follows, and even Professor Hutchinson,
who occupied the chair of English in that urban
community of learning that so curiously bisects
the neighborhood of Harlem, could not have designated
Eleanor&#8217;s description of his daughter as
one that did not describe.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
<p>It was this &#8220;shadow of a sickness,&#8221; that served
to segregate Margaret to the extent that was
really necessary for her well being. To have
shared perpetually in the almost superhuman activities
of the family might have forever dulled
that delicate spirit to which Eleanor came to owe
so much in the various stages of her development.</p>
<p>Margaret put her arm about the child after the
ordeal of the first dinner at the big table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father does not bite,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but Grandfather
does. The others are quite harmless. If
Grandfather shows his teeth, run for your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where to run to,&#8221; Eleanor
answered seriously, whereupon Margaret hugged
her. Her Aunt Margaret would have been
puzzling to Eleanor beyond any hope of extrication,
but for the quick imagination that unwound
her riddles almost as she presented them. For one
terrible minute Eleanor had believed that Hugh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Hutchinson senior did bite, he looked so much like
some of the worst of the pictures in Little Red
Riding Hood.</p>
<p>&#8220;While you are here I&#8217;m going to pretend you&#8217;re
my very own child,&#8221; Margaret told Eleanor that
first evening, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll never, never tell anybody
all the foolish games we play and the things we
say to each other. I can just barely manage to be
grown up in the bosom of my family, and when I
am in the company of your esteemed Aunt Beulah,
but up here in my room, Eleanor, I am never grown
up. I play with dolls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! do you really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really do,&#8221; Margaret said. She opened a
funny old chest in the corner of the spacious, high
studded chamber. &#8220;And here are some of the
dolls that I play with.&#8221; She produced a manikin
dressed primly after the manner of eighteen-thirty,
prim parted hair over a small head festooned with
ringlets, a fichu, and mits painted on her fingers.
&#8220;Beulah,&#8221; she said with a mischievous flash of a
grimace at Eleanor. &#8220;Gertrude,&#8221;&mdash;a dashing young
brunette in riding clothes. &#8220;Jimmie,&#8221;&mdash;a curly
haired dandy. &#8220;David,&#8221;&mdash;a serious creature with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
a monocle. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t find Peter,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but
we&#8217;ll make him some day out of cotton and water
colors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! can you make dolls?&#8221; Eleanor cried in
delight, &#8220;real dolls with hair and different colored
eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make pretty good ones,&#8221; Margaret
smiled; &#8220;manikins like these,&mdash;a Frenchwoman
taught me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh; did she? And do you play that the dolls
talk to each other as if they was&mdash;were the
persons?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; Margaret assembled the four manikins
into a smart little group. The doll Beulah rose,&mdash;on
her forefinger. &#8220;I can&#8217;t help feeling,&#8221; mimicked
Margaret in a perfect reproduction of Beulah&#8217;s
earnest contralto, &#8220;that we&#8217;re wasting our lives,&mdash;criminally
dissipating our forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doll Gertrude put up both hands. &#8220;I want
to laugh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;won&#8217;t everybody please stop
talking till I&#8217;ve had my laugh out. Thank you,
thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s just like Aunt Gertrude,&#8221; Eleanor
said. &#8220;Her voice has that kind of a sound like a
bell, only more ripply.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be high-brow,&#8221; Jimmie&#8217;s lazy baritone besought
with the slight burring of the &#8220;r&#8217;s&#8221; that
Eleanor found so irresistible. &#8220;I&#8217;m only a poor
hard-working, business man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doll David took the floor deliberately. &#8220;We
intend to devote the rest of our lives,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;to the care of our beloved cooperative orphan.&#8221;
On that he made a rather over mannered exit,
Margaret planting each foot down deliberately
until she flung him back in his box. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
kind of a silly your Aunt Margaret is,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;but you mustn&#8217;t ever tell anybody,
Eleanor.&#8221; She clasped the child again in one of
her warm, sudden embraces, and Eleanor squeezing
her shyly in return was altogether enraptured with
her new existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there isn&#8217;t any doll for <i>you</i>, Aunt Margaret,&#8221;
she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! yes, there is, but I wasn&#8217;t going to show
her to you unless you asked, because she&#8217;s so nice.
I saved the prettiest one of all to be myself, not
because I believe I&#8217;m so beautiful, but&mdash;but only
because I&#8217;d like to be, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always pretend I&#8217;m a princess,&#8221; Eleanor admitted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>The Aunt Margaret doll was truly a beautiful
creation, a little more like Marie Antoinette than
her namesake, but bearing a not inconsiderable resemblance
to both, as Margaret pointed out,
judicially analyzing her features.</p>
<p>Eleanor played with the rabbit doll only at night
after this. In the daytime she looked rather battered
and ugly to eyes accustomed to the delicate
finish of creatures like the French manikins, but
after she was tucked away in her cot in the passion
flower dressing-room&mdash;all of Margaret&#8217;s belongings
and decorations were a faint, pinky lavender,&mdash;her
dear daughter Gwendolyn, who impersonated
Albertina at increasingly rare intervals as time advanced,
lay in the hollow of her arm and received
her sacred confidences and ministrations as usual.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;When my two (2) months are up here I think
I should be quite sorry,&#8221; she wrote in the diary,
&#8220;except that I&#8217;m going to Uncle Peter next, and
him I would lay me down and dee for, only I
never get time enough to see him, and know if
he wants me to, when I live with him I shall
know. Well life is very exciting all the time now.
Aunt Margaret brings me up this way. She tells
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
me that she loves me and that I&#8217;ve got beautiful
eyes and hair and am sweet. She tells me that all
the time. She says she wants to love me up
enough to last because I never had love enough
before. I like to be loved. Albertina never loves
any one, but on Cape Cod nobody loves anybody&mdash;not
to say so anyway. If a man is getting married
they say he <i>likes</i> that girl he is going to
marry. In New York they act as different as
they eat. The Hutchinsons act different from
anybody. They do not know Aunt Margaret has
adoptid me. Nobody knows I am adoptid but
me and my aunts and uncles. Miss Prentis and
Aunt Beulah&#8217;s mother when she came home and
all the bohemiar ladies and all the ten Hutchinsons
think I am a little visiting girl from the country.
It is nobody&#8217;s business because I am supported
out of allowances and salaries, but it makes me
feel queer sometimes. I feel like</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I like having six homes, but I wish everybody
knew it. I am nothing to be ashamed of. Speaking
of homes I asked Aunt Margaret why my
aunts and uncles did not marry each other and
make it easier for every one. She said they were
not going to get married. That was why they
adoptid me. &#8216;Am I the same thing as getting
married?&#8217; I ast. She said no, I wasn&#8217;t except
that I was a responsibility to keep them unselfish
and real. Aunt Beulah doesn&#8217;t believe in marriage.
She thinks its beneth her. Aunt Margaret
doesn&#8217;t think she has the health. Aunt Gertrude
has to have a career of sculpture, Uncle David has
got to marry some one his mother says to or not
at all, and does not like to marry anyway. Uncle
Jimmie never saw a happy mariage yet and thinks
you have a beter time in single blesedness. Uncle
Peter did not sign in the book where they said
they would adopt me and not marry. They did
not want to ask him because he had some trouble
once. I wonder what kind! Well I am going to
be married sometime. I want a house to do the
housework in and a husband and a backyard full
of babies. Perhaps I would rather have a hired
butler and gold spoons. I don&#8217;t know yet. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
course I would like to have time to write poetry.
I can sculpture too, but I don&#8217;t want a career of
it because it&#8217;s so dirty.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Physically Eleanor throve exceedingly during
this phase of her existence. The nourishing food
and regular living, the sympathy established between
herself and Margaret, the r&eacute;gime of physical
exercise prescribed by Beulah which she had been
obliged guiltily to disregard during the strenuous
days of her existence in Washington Square, all
contributed to the accentuation of her material
well-being. She played with Margaret&#8217;s nephew,
and ran up and down stairs on errands for her
mother. She listened to the tales related for her
benefit by the old people, and gravely accepted the
attentions of the two formidable young men of the
family, who entertained her with the pianola and
excerpts from classic literature and folk lore.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;The We Are Sevens meet every Saturday
afternoon,&#8221; she wrote&mdash;on a yellow page this time&mdash;&#8220;usually
at Aunt Beulah&#8217;s house. We have tea
and lots of fun. I am examined on what I have
learned but I don&#8217;t mind it much. Physically I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
found to be very good by measure and waite. My
mind is developing alright. I am very bright on
the subject of poetry. They do not know whether
David Copperfield had been a wise choice for me,
but when I told them the story and talked about
it they said I had took it right. I don&#8217;t tell them
about the love part of Aunt Margaret&#8217;s bringing
up. Aunt Beulah says it would make me self conscioush
to know that I had such pretty eyes and
hair. Aunt Gertrude said &#8216;why not mention my
teeth to me, then,&#8217; but no one seemed to think so.
Aunt Beulah says not to develope my poetry because
the theory is to strengthen the weak part of
the bridge, and make me do arithmetic. &#8216;Drill on
the deficiency,&#8217; she says. Well I should think the
love part was a deficiency, but Aunt Beulah thinks
love is weak and beneath her and any one. Uncle
David told me privately that he thought I was
having the best that could happen to me right now
being with Aunt Margaret. I didn&#8217;t tell him that
the David doll always gets put away in the box
with the Aunt Margaret doll and nobody else ever,
but I should like to have. He thinks she is the
best aunt too.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>Some weeks later she wrote to chronicle a painful
scene in which she had participated.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;I quarreled with the ten Hutchinsons. I am
very sorry. They laughed at me too much for
being a little girl and a Cape Codder, but they
could if they wanted to, but when they laughed at
Aunt Margaret for adopting me and the tears came
in her eyes I could not bare it. I did not let the
cat out of the bag, but I made it jump out. The
Grandfather asked me when I was going back to
Cape Cod, and I said I hoped never, and then I
said I was going to visit Uncle Peter and Aunt
Gertrude and Uncle David next. They said &#8216;Uncle
David&mdash;do you mean David Bolling?&#8217; and I did,
so I said &#8216;yes.&#8217; Then all the Hutchinsons pitched
into Aunt Margaret and kept laughing and saying,
&#8216;Who is this mysterious child anyway, and how is
it that her guardians intrust her to a crowd of
scatter brain youngsters for so long?&#8217; and then
they said &#8216;Uncle David Bolling&mdash;<i>what</i> does his
mother say?&#8217; Then Aunt Margaret got very red
in the face and the tears started to come, and I
said &#8216;I am not a mysterious child, and my Uncle
David is as much my Uncle David as they all are,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
and then I said &#8216;My Aunt Margaret has got a perfect
right to have me intrusted to her at any time,
and not to be laughed at for it,&#8217; and I went and
stood in front of her and gave her my handkercheve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I am glad somebody has been told that
I am properly adoptid, but I am sorry it is the ten
Hutchinsons who know.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Peter</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Uncle Peter treated her as if she were grown
up; that was the wonderful thing about
her visit to him,&mdash;if there could be one thing
about it more wonderful than another. From the
moment when he ushered her into his friendly,
low ceiled drawing-room with its tiers upon tiers
of book shelves, he admitted her on terms of
equality to the miraculous order of existence that
it was the privilege of her life to share. The pink
silk coverlet and the elegance of the silver coated
steampipes at Beulah&#8217;s; the implacable British
stuffiness at the Winchester which had had its own
stolid charm for the lineal descendant of the Pilgrim
fathers; the impressively casual atmosphere
over which the &#8220;hired butler&#8221; presided distributing
after-dinner gold spoons, these impressions all
dwindled and diminished and took their insignificant
place in the background of the romance she
was living and breathing in Peter&#8217;s jewel box of
an apartment on Thirtieth Street.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>Even to more sophisticated eyes than Eleanor&#8217;s
the place seemed to be a realized ideal of charm
and homeliness. It was one of the older fashioned
duplex apartments designed in a more aristocratic
decade for a more fastidious generation, yet sufficiently
adapted to the modern insistence on technical
convenience. Peter owed his home to his
married sister, who had discovered it and leased
it and settled it and suddenly departed for a five
years&#8217; residence in China with her husband, who
was as she so often described him, &#8220;a blooming
Englishman, and an itinerant banker.&#8221; Peter&#8217;s domestic
affairs were despatched by a large, motherly
Irishwoman, whom Eleanor approved of on sight
and later came to respect and adore without reservation.</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s home was a home with a place in it for
her&mdash;a place that it was perfectly evident was better
with her than without her. She even slept in
the bed that Peter&#8217;s sister&#8217;s little girl had occupied,
and there were pictures on the walls that had been
selected for her.</p>
<p>She had been very glad to make her escape from
the Hutchinson household. Her &#8220;quarrel&#8221; with
them had made no difference in their relation to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
her. To her surprise they treated her with an
increase of deference after her outburst, and every
member of the family, excepting possibly Hugh
Hutchinson senior, was much more carefully polite
to her. Margaret explained that the family really
didn&#8217;t mind having their daughter a party to the
experiment of cooperative parenthood. It appealed
to them as a very interesting try-out of
modern educational theory, and their own theories
of the independence of the individual modified
their criticism of Margaret&#8217;s secrecy in the matter,
which was the only criticism they had to make since
Margaret had an income of her own accruing from
the estate of the aunt for whom she had been
named.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very silly of me to be sensitive about
being laughed at,&#8221; Margaret concluded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived
all my life surrounded by people suffering from
an acute sense of humor, but I never, never, never
shall get used to being held up to ridicule for
things that are not funny to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you would,&#8221; Eleanor answered
devoutly.</p>
<p>In Peter&#8217;s house there was no one to laugh at
her but Peter, and when Peter laughed she considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
it a triumph. It meant that there was
something she said that he liked. The welcome
she had received as a guest in his house and the
wonderful evening that succeeded it were among
the epoch making hours in Eleanor&#8217;s life. It had
happened in this wise.</p>
<p>The Hutchinson victoria, for Grandmother
Hutchinson still clung to the old-time, stately
method of getting about the streets of New York,
had left her at Peter&#8217;s door at six o&#8217;clock of a
keen, cool May evening. Margaret had not been
well enough to come with her, having been prostrated
by one of the headaches of which she was
a frequent victim.</p>
<p>The low door of ivory white, beautifully carved
and paneled, with its mammoth brass knocker, the
row of window boxes along the cornice a few feet
above it, the very look of the house was an experience
and an adventure to her. When she rang,
the door opened almost instantly revealing Peter
on the threshold with his arms open. He had led
her up two short flights of stairs&mdash;ivory white with
carved banisters, she noticed, all as immaculately
shining with soap and water as a Cape Cod interior&mdash;to
his own gracious drawing-room where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
Mrs. Finnigan was bowing and smiling a warmhearted
Irish welcome to her. It was like a wonderful
story in a book and her eyes were shining
with joy as Uncle Peter pulled out her chair and
she sat down to the first meal in her honor. The
grown up box of candy at her plate, the grave
air with which Peter consulted her tastes and
her preferences were all a part of a beautiful magic
that had never quite touched her before.</p>
<p>She had been like a little girl in a dream passing
dutifully or delightedly through the required phases
of her experience, never quite believing in its permanence
or reality; but her life with Uncle Peter
was going to be real, and her own. That was
what she felt the moment she stepped over his
threshold.</p>
<p>After their coffee before the open fire&mdash;she herself
had had &#8220;cambric&#8221; coffee&mdash;Peter smoked his
cigar, while she curled up in silence in the twin
to his big cushioned chair and sampled her chocolates.
The blue flames skimmed the bed of black
coals, and finally settled steadily at work on them
nibbling and sputtering until the whole grate was
like a basket full of molten light, glowing and
golden as the hot sun when it sinks into the sea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>Except to offer her the ring about his slender
Panatela, and to ask her if she were happy, Peter
did not speak until he had deliberately crushed
out the last spark from his stub and thrown it into
the fire. The ceremony over, he held out his arms
to her and she slipped into them as if that moment
were the one she had been waiting for ever since
the white morning looked into the window of the
lavender dressing-room on Morningside Heights,
and found her awake and quite cold with the excitement
of thinking of what the day was to bring
forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; Peter said, when he was sure she
was comfortably arranged with her head on his
shoulder, &#8220;Eleanor, I want you to feel at home
while you are here, really at home, as if you hadn&#8217;t
any other home, and you and I belonged to each
other. I&#8217;m almost too young to be your father,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! are you?&#8221; Eleanor asked fervently, as he
paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;But I can come pretty near feeling like a
father to you if it&#8217;s a father you want. I lost
my own father when I was a little older than you
are now, but I had my dear mother and sister
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
left, and so I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to be all
alone in the world, and I can&#8217;t always understand
exactly how you feel, but you must always remember
that I want to understand and that I will understand
if you tell me. Will you remember that,
Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Peter,&#8221; she said soberly; then perhaps
for the first time since her babyhood she volunteered
a caress that was not purely maternal in
its nature. She put up a shy hand to the cheek
so close to her own and patted it earnestly. &#8220;Of
course I&#8217;ve got my grandfather and grandmother,&#8221;
she argued, &#8220;but they&#8217;re very old, and not very
affectionate, either. Then I have all these new
aunts and uncles pretending,&#8221; she was penetrating
to the core of the matter, Peter realized, &#8220;that
they&#8217;re just as good as parents. Of course, they&#8217;re
just as good as they can be and they take so much
trouble that it mortifies me, but it isn&#8217;t just the
same thing, Uncle Peter!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;I know, dear, but you
must remember we mean well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean you; it isn&#8217;t you that I think of
when I think about my co&mdash;co-woperative parents,
and it isn&#8217;t any of them specially,&mdash;it&#8217;s just the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
idea of&mdash;of visiting around, and being laughed at,
and not really belonging to anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s arms tightened about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! but you do belong, you do belong. You
belong to me, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was what I hoped you would say, Uncle
Peter,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>They had a long talk after this, discussing the
past and the future; the past few months of the experiment
from Eleanor&#8217;s point of view, and the
future in relation to its failures and successes.
Beulah was to begin giving her lessons again and
she was to take up music with a visiting teacher
on Peter&#8217;s piano. (Eleanor had not known it was
a piano at first, as she had never seen a baby grand
before. Peter did not know what a triumph it
was when she made herself put the question to
him.)</p>
<p>&#8220;If my Aunt Beulah could teach me as much
as she does and make it as interesting as Aunt
Margaret does, I think I would make her feel
very proud of me,&#8221; Eleanor said. &#8220;I get so nervous
saving energy the way Aunt Beulah says for me
to that I forget all the lesson. Aunt Margaret
tells too many stories, I guess, but I like them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your Aunt Margaret is a child of God,&#8221; Peter
said devoutly, &#8220;in spite of her raw-boned, intellectual
family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle David says she&#8217;s a daughter of the
fairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s that, too. When Margaret&#8217;s a year or
two older you won&#8217;t feel the need of a mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t now,&#8221; said Eleanor; &#8220;only a father,&mdash;that
I want you to be, the way you promised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s done,&#8221; Peter said. Then he continued
musingly, &#8220;You&#8217;ll find Gertrude&mdash;different. I can&#8217;t
quite imagine her presiding over your moral welfare
but I think she&#8217;ll be good at it. She&#8217;s a good
deal of a person, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Beulah&#8217;s a good kind of person, too,&#8221;
Eleanor said; &#8220;she tries hard. The only thing is
that she keeps trying to make me express myself,
and I don&#8217;t know what that means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see if I can tell you,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;Self-expression
is a part of every man&#8217;s duty. Inside
we are all trying to be good and true and fine&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except the villains,&#8221; Eleanor interposed. &#8220;People
like Iago aren&#8217;t trying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll make an exception of the villains;
we&#8217;re talking of people like us, pretty good people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
with the right instincts. Well then, if all the time
we&#8217;re trying to be good and true and fine, we
carry about a blank face that reflects nothing of
what we are feeling and thinking, the world is a
little worse off, a little duller and heavier place
for what is going on inside of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how can we make it better off then?&#8221;
Eleanor inquired practically.</p>
<p>&#8220;By not thinking too much about it for one
thing, except to remember to smile, by trying to
be just as much at home in it as possible, by letting
the kind of person we are trying to be show
through on the outside. By gosh! I wish Beulah
could hear me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By just not being bashful, do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when Aunt Beulah makes me do those
dancing exercises, standing up in the middle of the
floor and telling me to be a flower and express
myself as a flower, does she just mean not to be
bashful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like that: she means stop thinking
of yourself and go ahead&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can I go ahead with her sitting there
watching?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I ought to tell you to imagine that
you had the soul of a flower, but I haven&#8217;t the
nerve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got nerve enough to do anything,&#8221;
Eleanor assured him, but she meant it admiringly,
and seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the nerve to go on with a moral conversation
in which you are getting the better of
me at every turn,&#8221; Peter laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s
unintentional, but you make me feel like a good
deal of an ass, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means a donkey, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does, and by jove, I believe that you&#8217;re
glad of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do rather like it,&#8221; said Eleanor; &#8220;of course
you don&#8217;t really feel like a donkey to me. I mean
I don&#8217;t make you feel like one, but it&#8217;s funny just
pretending that you mean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! woman, woman,&#8221; Peter cried. &#8220;Beulah
tried to convey something of the fact that you
always got the better of every one in your modest
unassuming way, but I never quite believed it
before. At any rate it&#8217;s bedtime, and here comes
Mrs. Finnigan to put you to bed. Kiss me good
night, sweetheart.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>Eleanor flung her arms about his neck, in her
first moment of abandonment to actual emotional
self-expression if Peter had only known it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will never really get the better of you in my
life, Uncle Peter,&#8221; she promised him passionately.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Omniscient Focus</span></h3>
</div>
<p>One of the traditional prerogatives of an
Omnipotent Power is to look down at the
activities of earth at any given moment and ascertain
simultaneously the occupation of any number
of people. Thus the Arch Creator&mdash;that Being of
the Supreme Artistic Consciousness&mdash;is able to
peer into segregated interiors at His own discretion
and watch the plot thicken and the drama
develop. Eleanor, who often visualized this proceeding,
always imagined a huge finger projecting
into space, cautiously tilting the roofs of the
Houses of Man to allow the sweep of the Invisible
Glance.</p>
<p>Granting the hypothesis of the Divine privilege,
and assuming for the purposes of this narrative
the Omniscient focus on the characters most concerned
in it, let us for the time being look over
the shoulder of God and inform ourselves of their
various occupations and preoccupations of a Saturday
afternoon in late June during the hour before
dinner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>Eleanor, in her little white chamber on Thirtieth
Street, was engaged in making a pink and green
toothbrush case for a going-away gift for her
Uncle Peter. To be sure she was going away with
him when he started for the Long Island beach
hotel from which he proposed to return every day
to his office in the city, but she felt that a slight
token of her affection would be fitting and proper
on the eve of their joint departure. She was
hurrying to get it done that she might steal softly
into the dining-room and put it on his plate undetected.
Her eyes were very wide, her brow intent
and serious, and her delicate lips lightly parted.
At that moment she bore a striking resemblance to
the Botticelli head in Beulah&#8217;s drawing-room that
she had so greatly admired.</p>
<p>Of all the people concerned in her history, she
was the most tranquilly occupied.</p>
<p>Peter in the room beyond was packing his trunk
and his suit-case. At this precise stage of his
proceedings he was trying to make two decisions,
equally difficult, but concerned with widely different
departments of his consciousness. He was
gravely considering whether or not to include
among his effects the photograph before him on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
the dressing-table&mdash;that of the girl to whom he had
been engaged from the time he was a Princeton
sophomore until her death four years later&mdash;and
also whether or not it would be worth his while
to order a new suit of white flannels so late in
the season. The fact that he finally decided against
the photograph and in favor of the white flannels
has nothing to do with the relative importance of
the two matters thus engrossing him. The health
of the human mind depends largely on its ability
to assemble its irrelevant and incongruous problems
in dignified yet informal proximity. When he went
to his desk it was with the double intention of addressing
a letter to his tailor, and locking the
cherished photograph in a drawer; but, the letter
finished, he still held the picture in his hand and
gazed down at it mutely and when the discreet
knock on his door that constituted the announcing
of dinner came, he was still sitting motionless with
the photograph propped up before him.</p>
<p>Up-town, Beulah, whose dinner hour came late,
was rather more actively, though possibly not more
significantly, occupied. She was doing her best to
evade the wild onslaught of a young man in
glasses who had been wanting to marry her for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
considerable period, and had now broken all bounds
in a cumulative attempt to inform her of the fact.</p>
<p>Though he was assuredly in no condition to
listen to reason, Beulah was reasoning with him,
kindly and philosophically, paying earnest attention
to the style and structure of her remarks as she
did so. Her emotions, as is usual on such occasions,
were decidedly mixed. She was conscious
of a very real dismay at her unresponsiveness, a
distress for the acute pain from which the distraught
young man seemed to be suffering, and
the thrill, which had she only known it, is the unfailing
accompaniment to the first eligible proposal
of marriage. In the back of her brain there was
also, so strangely is the human mind constituted,
a kind of relief at being able to use mature logic
once more, instead of the dilute form of moral
dissertation with which she tried to adapt herself
to Eleanor&#8217;s understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never intend to marry any one,&#8221; she was explaining
gently. &#8220;I not only never intend to, but
I am pledged in a way that I consider irrevocably
binding never to marry,&#8221;&mdash;and that was the text
from which all the rest of her discourse developed.</p>
<p>Jimmie, equally bound by the oath of celibacy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
but not equally constrained by it apparently, was
at the very moment when Beulah was so successfully
repulsing the familiarity of the high cheek-boned
young man in the black and white striped
tie, occupied in encouraging a familiarity of a like
nature. That is, he was holding the hand of a
young woman in the darkened corner of a drawing-room
which had been entirely unfamiliar to him
ten days before, and was about to impress a caress
on lips that seemed to be ready to meet his with a
certain degree of accustomed responsiveness. That
this was not a peculiarly significant incident in Jimmie&#8217;s
career might have been difficult to explain,
at least to the feminine portion of the group of
friends he cared most for.</p>
<p>Margaret, dressed for an academic dinner party,
in white net with a girdle of pale pink and lavender
ribbons, had flung herself face downward on her
bed in reckless disregard of her finery; and because
it was hot and she was homesick for green
fields and the cool stretches of dim wooded country,
had transported herself in fancy and still in
her recumbent attitude to the floor of a canoe that
was drifting down-stream between lush banks of
meadow grass studded with marsh lilies. After
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
some interval&mdash;and shift of position&mdash;the way was
arched overhead with whispering trees, the stars
came out one by one, showing faintly between
waving branches; and she perceived dimly that a
figure that was vaguely compounded of David and
Peter and the handsomest of all the young kings
of Spain, had quietly taken its place in the bow
and had busied itself with the paddles,&mdash;whereupon
she was summoned to dinner, where the ten Hutchinsons
and their guests were awaiting her.</p>
<p>David, the only member of the group whose
summer vacation had actually begun, was sitting
on the broad veranda of an exclusive country club
several hundreds of miles away from New York
and looking soberly into the eyes of a blue ribbon
bull dog, whose heavy jowl rested on his knees.
His mother, in one of the most fashionable versions
of the season&#8217;s foulards, sleekly corseted and
coifed, was sitting less than a hundred yards away
from him, fanning herself with three inches of
hand woven fan and contemplating David. In the
dressing-room above, just alighted from a limousine
de luxe, was a raven-haired, crafty-eyed
ing&eacute;nue (whose presence David did not suspect
or he would have recollected a sudden pressing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
engagement out of her vicinity), preening herself
for conquest. David&#8217;s mind, unlike the minds of
the &#8220;other gifted members of the We Are Seven
Club,&#8221; to quote Jimmie&#8217;s most frequent way of
referring to them, was to all intents and purposes
a total blank. He answered monosyllabically his
mother&#8217;s questions, patted the dog&#8217;s beetling forehead
and thought of nothing at all for practically
forty-five minutes. Then he rose, and offering his
arm to his mother led her gravely to the table reserved
for him in the dining-room.</p>
<p>Gertrude, in her studio at the top of the house
in Fifty-sixth Street where she lived with her
parents, was putting the finishing touches on a
faun&#8217;s head; and a little because she had unconsciously
used Jimmie&#8217;s head for her model, and
a little because of her conscious realization at this
moment that the roughly indicated curls over the
brow were like nobody&#8217;s in the world but Jimmie&#8217;s,
she was thinking of him seriously. She was thinking
also of the dinner on a tray that would presently
be brought up to her, since her mother and
father were out of town, and of her coming two
months with Eleanor and her recent inspiration
concerning them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>In Colhassett, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the dinner
hour and even the supper hour were long past.
In the commodious kitchen of Eleanor&#8217;s former
home two old people were sitting in calico valanced
rockers, one by either window. The house was
a pleasant old colonial structure, now badly run
down but still marked with that distinction that
only the instincts of aristocracy can bestow upon
a decaying habitation.</p>
<p>A fattish child made her way up the walk, toeing
out unnecessarily, and let herself in by the back
door without knocking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Mis&#8217; Chase and Mr. Amos,&#8221; she said,
seating herself in a straight backed, yellow chair,
and swinging her crossed foot nonchalantly, &#8220;I
thought I would come in to inquire about Eleanor.
Ma said that she heard that she was coming home
to live again. Is she, Mr. Amos?&#8221;</p>
<p>Albertina was not a peculiar favorite of
Eleanor&#8217;s grandfather. Amos Chase had ideas of
his own about the proper bringing up of children,
and the respect due from them to their elders.
Also Albertina&#8217;s father had come from &#8220;poor
stock.&#8221; There was a strain of bad blood in her.
The women of the Weston families hadn&#8217;t always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
&#8220;behaved themselves.&#8221; He therefore answered this
representative of the youngest generation rather
shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know nothing about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, father,&#8221; the querulous old voice of
Grandmother Chase protested, &#8220;you know she&#8217;s
comin&#8217; home somewhere &#8217;bout the end of July, she
and one of her new aunties and a hired girl they&#8217;re
bringing along to do the work. I don&#8217;t see why
you can&#8217;t answer the child&#8217;s question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;m obligated to answer any
questions that anybody sees fit to put to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>be</i>. Albertina, pass me my glasses from
off the mantel-tree-shelf, and that letter sticking
out from behind the clock and I&#8217;ll read what she
says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Albertina, with a reproachful look at Mr. Amos,
who retired coughing exasperatedly behind a paper
that he did not read, allowed herself to be
informed through the medium of a letter from
Gertrude and a postscript from Eleanor of the projected
invasion of the Chase household.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d rather have Eleanor come
home by herself than bringing a strange woman
and a hired girl,&#8221; Albertina contributed a trifle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
tartly. The distinction of a hired girl in the family
was one which she had long craved on her own
account.</p>
<p>&#8220;All nonsense, I call it,&#8221; the old man ejaculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Eleena, she writes that she can&#8217;t get away
without one of &#8217;em comin&#8217; along with her and I
guess we can manage someways. I dunno what
work city help will make in this kitchen. You
can&#8217;t expect much from city help. They ain&#8217;t clean
like home folks. I shall certainly be dretful pleased
to see Eleena, and so will her grandpa&mdash;in spite
o&#8217; the way he goes on about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A snort came from the region of the newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d feel as if you had a
grandchild now that six rich people has adopted
her,&#8221; Albertina suggested helpfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing for the child,&#8221; her grandmother
said. &#8220;I&#8217;m so lame I couldn&#8217;t do my duty
by her. Old folks is old folks, and they can&#8217;t do
for others like young ones. I&#8217;d d&#8217;ruther have had
her adopted by one father and mother instead o&#8217;
this passel o&#8217; young folks passing her around among
themselves, but you can&#8217;t have what you&#8217;d d&#8217;ruther
have in this world. You got to take what comes
and be thankful.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did she write you about having gold coffee
spoons at her last place?&#8221; Albertina asked. &#8220;I
think they was probably gilded over like ice-cream
spoons, and she didn&#8217;t know the difference. I guess
she has got a lot of new clothes. Well, I&#8217;ll have
to be getting along. I&#8217;ll come in again.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the precise moment that the door closed behind
Albertina, the clock in Peter Stuyvesant&#8217;s
apartment in New York struck seven and Eleanor,
in a fresh white dress and blue ribbons, slipped
into her chair at the dinner table and waited with
eyes blazing with excitement for Peter to make
the momentous discovery of the gift at his plate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Gertrude Has Trouble with Her Behavior</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dear Uncle Peter,&#8221; Eleanor wrote from
Colhassett when she had been established
there under the new r&eacute;gime for a week or more.
&#8220;I slapped Albertina&#8217;s face. I am very awfully
sorry, but I could not help it. Don&#8217;t tell Aunt
Margaret because it is so contrary to her teachings
and also the golden rule, but she was more contrary
to the golden rule that I was. I mean Albertina.
What do you think she said? She said Aunt
Gertrude was homely and an old maid, and the
hired girl was homely too. Well, I think she is,
but I am not going to have Albertina think so.
Aunt Gertrude is pretty with those big eyes and
ink like hair and lovely teeth and one dimple. Albertina
likes hair fuzzed all over faces and blonds.
Then she said she guessed I wasn&#8217;t your favorite,
and that the gold spoons were most likely tin
gilded over. I don&#8217;t know what you think about
slapping. Will you please write and say what you
think? You know I am anxsuch to do well. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
I think I know as much as Albertina about some
things. She uster treat me like a dog, but it is
most a year now since I saw her before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here we are, Aunt Gertrude and me, too.
Grandpa did not like her at first. She looked so
much like summer folks, and acted that way, too.
He does not agree with summer folks, but she
got him talking about foreign parts and that Spanish
girl that made eyes at him, and nearly got him
away from Grandma, and the time they were
wrecked going around the horn, and showing her
dishes and carvings from China. Now he likes
her first rate. She laughs all the time. Grandma
likes her too, but not when Grandpa tells her about
that girl in Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We eat in the dining-room, and have lovely
food, only Grandpa does not like it, but we have
him a pie now for breakfast,&mdash;his own pie that
he can eat from all the time and he feels better.
Aunt Gertrude is happy seeing him eat it for
breakfast and claps her hands when he does it,
only he doesn&#8217;t see her.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is teaching me more manners, and to swim,
and some French. It is vacation and I don&#8217;t have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
regular lessons, the way I did while we were on
Long Island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t we have a good time in that hotel? Do
you remember the night I stayed up till ten o&#8217;clock
and we sat on the beach and talked? I do. I
love you very much. I think it is nice to love anybody.
Only I miss you. I would miss you more
if I believed what Albertina said about my not
being your favorite. I am.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you could come down here. Uncle
Jimmie is coming and then I don&#8217;t know what Albertina
will say.</p>
<p>&#8220;About teaching me. Aunt Gertrude&#8217;s idea of
getting me cultivated is to read to me from the
great Masters of literature and funny books too,
like Mark Twain and the Nonsense Thology. Then
I say what I think of them, and she just lets me
develop along those lines, which is pretty good for
summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is a poem I wrote. I love you best.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of slapping, Aunt Gertrude?&#8221;
Eleanor asked one evening when they
were walking along the hard beach that the receding
tide had left cool and firm for their pathway,
and the early moon had illumined for them.
&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s awfully bad to slap any one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t slap you, if that&#8217;s what you mean,
Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you slap somebody your own size and a
little bigger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might under extreme provocation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps you would,&#8221; Eleanor sighed
with a gasp of relieved satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in moral suasion entirely,
Eleanor,&#8221; Gertrude tried to follow Eleanor&#8217;s leads,
until she had in some way satisfied the child&#8217;s need
for enlightenment on the subject under discussion.
It was not always simple to discover just what
Eleanor wanted to know, but Gertrude had come
to believe that there was always some excellent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
reason for her wanting to know it. &#8220;I think
there are some quarrels that have to be settled by
physical violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor nodded. Then,</p>
<p>&#8220;What about refinement?&#8221; she asked unexpectedly.
&#8220;I want to bring myself up good when&mdash;when
all of my aunts and uncles are too busy, or
don&#8217;t know. I want to grow up, and be ladylike
and a credit, and I&#8217;m getting such good culture
that I think I ought to, but&mdash;I get worried about
my refinement. City refinement is different from
country refinement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Refinement isn&#8217;t a thing that you can worry
about,&#8221; Gertrude began slowly. She realized perhaps
better than any of the others, being a better
balanced, healthier creature than either Beulah or
Margaret, that there were serious defects in the
scheme of cooperative parentage. Eleanor, thanks
to the overconscientious digging about her roots,
was acquiring a New England self-consciousness
about her processes. A child, Gertrude felt, should
be handed a code ready made and should be guided
by it without question until his maturer experience
led him to modify it. The trouble with trying to
explain this to Eleanor was that she had already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
had too many things explained to her, and the
doctrine of unselfconsciousness can not be inculcated
by an exploitation of it. &#8220;If you are
naturally a fine person your instinct will be to do
the fine thing. You must follow it when you feel
the instinct and not think about it between times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Uncle Peter&#8217;s idea,&#8221; Eleanor said, &#8220;that
not thinking. Well, I&#8217;ll try&mdash;but you and Uncle
Peter didn&#8217;t have six different parents and a
Grandpa and Grandma and Albertina all criticizing
your refinement in different ways. Don&#8217;t you ever
have any trouble with your behavior, Aunt
Gertrude?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gertrude laughed. The truth was that she was
having considerable trouble with her behavior since
Jimmie&#8217;s arrival two days before. She had thought
to spend her two months with Eleanor on Cape Cod
helping the child to relate her new environment to
her old, while she had the benefit of her native air
and the freedom of a rural summer. She also felt
that one of their number ought to have a working
knowledge of Eleanor&#8217;s early surroundings and
habits. She had meant to put herself and her own
concerns entirely aside. If she had a thought for
any one but Eleanor she meant it to be for the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
old people whose guest she had constituted herself.
She explained all this to Jimmie a day or two before
her departure, and to her surprise he had suggested
that he spend his own two vacation weeks
watching the progress of her experiment. Before
she was quite sure of the wisdom of allowing him
to do so she had given him permission to come.
Jimmie was part of her trouble. Her craving for
isolation and undiscovered country; her eagerness
to escape with her charge to some spot where she
would not be subjected to any sort of familiar surveillance,
were all a part of an instinct to segregate
herself long enough to work out the problem
of Jimmie and decide what to do about it. This
she realized as soon as he arrived on the spot. She
realized further that she had made practically no
progress in the matter, for this curly headed young
man, bearing no relation to anything that Gertrude
had decided a young man should be, was rapidly
becoming a serious menace to her peace of mind,
and her ideal of a future lived for art alone. She
had definitely begun to realize this on the night when
Jimmie, in his exuberance at securing his new job,
had seized her about the waist and kissed her on the
lips. She had thought a good deal about that kiss,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
which came dangerously near being her first one.
She was too clever, too cool and aloof, to have had
many tentative love-affairs. Later, as she softened
and warmed and gathered grace with the years she
was likely to seem more alluring and approachable
to the gregarious male. Now she answered her
small interlocutor truthfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Eleanor, I do have a whole lot of trouble
with my behavior. I&#8217;m having trouble with it today,
and this evening,&#8221; she glanced up at the moon,
which was seemingly throwing out conscious waves
of effulgence, &#8220;I expect to have more,&#8221; she confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! do you?&#8221; asked Eleanor, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t
sit up with you then and help you. You&mdash;you don&#8217;t
expect to be&mdash;provocated to <i>slap</i> anybody, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, but as things are going I almost
wish I did,&#8221; Gertrude answered, not realizing that
before the evening was over there would be one
person whom she would be ruefully willing to slap
several times over.</p>
<p>As they turned into the village street from the
beach road they met Jimmie, who had been having
his after-dinner pipe with Grandfather Amos, with
whom he had become a prime favorite. With him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
was Albertina, toeing out more than ever and conversing
more than blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This virtuous child has been urging me to come
after Eleanor and remind her that it is bedtime,&#8221;
Jimmie said, indicating the pink gingham clad figure
at his side. &#8220;She argues that Eleanor is some
six months younger than she and ought to be in
bed first, and personally she has got to go in the
next fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty hot weather to go to bed in,&#8221; Albertina
said. &#8220;Miss Sturgis, if I can get my mother to
let me stay up half an hour more, will you let
Eleanor stay up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just beyond her friend, in the shadow of her
ample back, Eleanor was making gestures intended
to convey the fact that sitting up any longer was
abhorrent to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor needs her sleep to-night, I think,&#8221; Gertrude
answered, professionally maternal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought Albertina so that our child might go
home under convoy, while you and I were walking
on the beach,&#8221; Jimmie suggested.</p>
<p>As the two little girls fell into step, the beginning
of their conversation drifted back to the other
two, who stood watching them for a moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d come over to see if you was willing
to say you were sorry,&#8221; Albertina began. &#8220;My
face stayed red in one spot for two hours that day
after you slapped me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sorry,&#8221; Eleanor said ungraciously, &#8220;but
I&#8217;ll say that I am, if you&#8217;ve come to make up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t say any more about it then,&#8221;
Albertina conceded. &#8220;Are Miss Sturgis and Mr.
Sears going together, or are they just friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that Albertina one the limit?&#8221; Jimmie inquired,
with a piloting hand under Gertrude&#8217;s elbow.
&#8220;She told me that she and Eleanor were mad,
but she didn&#8217;t want to stay mad because there was
more going on over here than there was at her
house and she liked to come over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad Eleanor slapped her,&#8221; Gertrude said;
&#8220;still I&#8217;m sorry our little girl has uncovered the
clay feet of her idol. She&#8217;s through with Albertina
for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Gertrude,&#8221; Jimmy said, as they
set foot on the glimmering beach, &#8220;you don&#8217;t seem
a bit natural lately. You used to be so full of the
everlasting mischief. Every time you opened your
mouth I dodged for fear of being spiked. Yet here
you are just as docile as other folks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like me&mdash;as well?&#8221; Gertrude tried
her best to make her voice sound as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better,&#8221; Jimmie swore promptly; then he added
a qualifying&mdash;&#8220;I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; But she didn&#8217;t allow him
the opportunity to answer. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a transition
period, Jimmie,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I meant to be such a
good parent to Eleanor and correct all the evil ways
into which she has fallen as a result of all her other
injudicious training, and, instead of that, I&#8217;m doing
nothing but think of myself and my own hankerings
and yearnings and such. I thought I could do
so much for the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way we all think till we tackle her
and then we find it quite otherwise and even more
so. Tell me about your hankerings and yearnings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about your job, Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for a little while they found themselves on
safe and familiar ground again. Jimmie&#8217;s new
position was a very satisfactory one. He found
himself associated with men of solidity and discernment,
and for the first time in his business
career he felt himself appreciated and stimulated
by that appreciation to do his not inconsiderable
best. Gertrude was the one woman&mdash;Eleanor had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
not yet attained the inches for that classification&mdash;to
whom he ever talked business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, at last, I feel that I&#8217;ve got my feet on the
earth, Gertrude; as if the stuff that was in me had
a chance to show itself, and you don&#8217;t know what
a good feeling that is after you&#8217;ve been marked
trash by your family and thrown into the dust heap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully glad, Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are, &#8217;Trude. You&#8217;re an awfully
good pal. It isn&#8217;t everybody I&#8217;d talk to like this.
Let&#8217;s sit down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moonlight beat down upon them in floods
of sentient palpitating glory. Little breathy waves
sought the shore and whispered to it. The pines
on the breast of the bank stirred softly and tenderly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, what a night,&#8221; Jimmie said, and began
burying her little white hand in the beach sand.
His breath was not coming quite evenly. &#8220;Now
tell me about your job,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I want to talk about my job tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; There was no question about
her voice sounding as usual this time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>Jimmie brushed the sand slowly away from the
buried hand and covered it with his own. He
drew nearer, his face close, and closer to hers.
Gertrude closed her eyes. It was coming, it was
coming and she was glad. That silly old vow of
celibacy, her silly old thoughts about art. What
was art? What was anything with the arms of the
man you loved closing about you. His lips were
on hers.</p>
<p>Jimmie drew a sharp breath, and let her go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gertrude,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m incorrigible. I ought
to be spanked. I&#8217;d make love to&mdash;Eleanor&#8217;s grandmother
if I had her down here on a night like this.
Will you forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gertrude got to her feet a little unsteadily, but
she managed a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the moon,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and&mdash;and young
blood. I think Grandfather Amos would probably
affect me the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie&#8217;s momentary expression of blankness
passed and Gertrude did not press her advantage.
They walked home in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully companionable to realize that you
also are human, &#8217;Trude,&#8221; he hazarded on the doorstep.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>Gertrude put a still hand into his, which is a way
of saying &#8220;Good night,&#8221; that may be more formal
than any other.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Colonel&#8217;s lady, and July O&#8217;Grady,&#8221; she
quoted lightly. &#8220;Good night, Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up-stairs in her great chamber under the eaves,
Eleanor was composing a poem which she copied
carefully on a light blue page of her private diary.
It read as follows:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;To love, it is the saddest thing,<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Madam Bolling</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Is this the child, David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor stared impassively into the lenses of
Mrs. Bolling&#8217;s lorgnette.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my mother, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor courtesied as her Uncle Jimmie had
taught her, but she did not take her eyes from Mrs.
Bolling&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bad-looking child. I hate this American
fashion of dressing children like French dolls, in
bright colors and smart lines. The English are so
much more sensible. An English country child
would have cheeks as red as apples. How old are
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleven years old my next birthday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have thought her younger, David.
Have her call me madam. It sounds better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, mother. I&#8217;ll teach her the ropes
when the strangeness begins to wear off. This kind
of thing is all new to her, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks it. Give her the blue chamber and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
tell Mademoiselle to take charge of her. You say
you want her to have lessons for so many hours a
day. Has she brains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s quite clever. She writes verses, she models
pretty well, Gertrude says. It&#8217;s too soon to
expect any special aptitude to develop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to discover your philanthropic
tendencies, David. I never knew you had any before,
but this seems to me a very doubtful undertaking.
You take a child like this from very plain
surroundings and give her a year or two of life
among cultivated and well-to-do people, just enough
for her to acquire a taste for extravagant living
and associations. Then what becomes of her? You
get tired of your bargain. Something else comes
on the docket. You marry&mdash;and then what becomes
of your prot&eacute;g&eacute;e? She goes back to the
country, a thoroughly unsatisfied little rustic, quite
unfitted to be the wife of the farmer for whom
fate intended her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t, mother,&#8221; David said, with
an uneasy glance at Eleanor&#8217;s pale face, set in the
stoic lines he remembered so well from the afternoon
of his first impression of her. &#8220;She&#8217;s a sensitive
little creature.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense. It never hurts anybody to have a
plain understanding of his position in the world.
I don&#8217;t know what foolishness you romantic young
people may have filled her head with. It&#8217;s just as
well she should hear common sense from me and
I intend that she shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve explained to you, mother, that this child is
my legal and moral responsibility and will be
partly at least under my care until she becomes of
age. I want her to be treated as you&#8217;d treat a child
of mine if I had one. If you don&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t have
her visit us again. I shall take her away with me
somewhere. Bringing her home to you this time is
only an experiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll have a much more healthful and normal
experience with us than she&#8217;s had with any of the
rest of your violent young set, I&#8217;ll be bound. She&#8217;ll
probably be useful, too. She can look out for
Zaidee&mdash;I never say that name without irritation&mdash;but
it&#8217;s the only name the little beast will answer
to. Do you like dogs, child?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor started at the suddenness of the question,
but did not reply to it. Mrs. Bolling waited
and David looked at her expectantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My mother asked you if you liked dogs,
Eleanor; didn&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor opened her lips as if to speak and then
shut them again firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your prot&eacute;g&eacute;e is slightly deaf, David,&#8221; his
mother assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell her &#8216;yes,&#8217;&#8221; Eleanor said unexpectedly
to David. &#8220;I like dogs, if they ain&#8217;t
treacherous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She asked you the question,&#8221; David said gravely;
&#8220;this is her house, you know. It is she who
deserves consideration in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t I talk to you about her, the way she
does about me?&#8221; Eleanor demanded. &#8220;She can
have consideration if she wants it, but she doesn&#8217;t
think I&#8217;m any account. Let her ask you what she
wants and I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; David remonstrated, &#8220;Eleanor, you
never behaved like this before. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s
got into her, mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She merely hasn&#8217;t any manners. Why should
she have?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor fixed her big blue eyes on the lorgnette
again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s manners to talk the way you do to your
own children and strange little girls, why, then I
don&#8217;t want any,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll be going,&#8221;
she added abruptly and turned toward the door.</p>
<p>David took her by the shoulders and brought her
right about face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say good-by to mother,&#8221; he said sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, ma&#8217;am&mdash;madam,&#8221; Eleanor said and
courtesied primly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Mademoiselle to teach her a few things
before the next audience, David, and come back to
me in fifteen minutes. I have something important
to talk over with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>David stood by the open door of the blue chamber
half an hour later and watched Eleanor on
her knees, repacking her suit-case. Her face was
set in pale determined lines, and she looked older
and a little sick. Outside it was blowing a September
gale, and the trees were waving desperate
branches in the wind. David had thought that the
estate on the Hudson would appeal to the little girl.
It had always appealed to him so much, even
though his mother&#8217;s habits of migration with the
others of her flock at the different seasons had left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
him so comparatively few associations with it. He
had thought she would like the broad sweeping
lawns and the cherubim fountain, the apple orchard
and the kitchen garden, and the funny old
bronze dog at the end of the box hedge. When he
saw how she was occupied, he understood that it
was not her intention to stay and explore these
things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; he said, stepping into the room suddenly,
&#8220;what are you doing with your suit-case?
Didn&#8217;t Mademoiselle unpack it for you?&#8221; He was
close enough now to see the signs of tears she had
shed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you packing it again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell and she tried desperately to control
a quivering lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I am&mdash;I want to go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Cape Cod.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t wanted,&#8221; she said, her head low. &#8220;I
made up my mind to go back to my own folks.
I&#8217;m not going to be adopted any more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>David led her to the deep window-seat and made
her sit facing him. He was too wise to attempt a
caress with this issue between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s altogether fair to me?&#8221; he
asked presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it won&#8217;t make much difference to you.
Something else will come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it will be fair to your other aunts
and uncles who have given so much care and
thought to your welfare?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll get tired of their bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they do get tired of their bargain it will be
because they&#8217;ve turned out to be very poor sports.
I&#8217;ve known every one of them a long time, and
I&#8217;ve never known them to show any signs of poor
sportsmanship yet. If you run away without giving
them their chance to make good, it will be you
who are the poor sport.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She said you would marry and get tired of me,
and I would have to go back to the country. If
you marry and Uncle Jimmie marries&mdash;then Uncle
Peter will marry, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d still have your Aunts Beulah and Margaret
and Gertrude,&#8221; David could not resist making
the suggestion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They could do it, too. If one person broke up
the vow, I guess they all would. Misfortunes never
come singly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But even if we did, Eleanor, even if we all
married, we&#8217;d still regard you as our own, our
child, our charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>She</i> said you wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221; The tears came now,
and David gathered the little shaking figure to his
breast. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be the wife of the farmer
for whom fate intended me,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;I want
to marry somebody refined with extravagant living
and associations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the things we are bringing you
up for, my dear.&#8221; This aspect of the case occurred
to David for the first time, but he realized its
potency. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t take mother too seriously.
Just jolly her along a little and you&#8217;ll soon get to
be famous friends. She&#8217;s never had any little girls
of her own, only my brother and me, and she
doesn&#8217;t know quite how to talk to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hutchinsons had a hired butler and gold
spoons, and they didn&#8217;t think I was the dust beneath
their feet. I don&#8217;t know what to say to
her. I said ain&#8217;t, and I wasn&#8217;t refined, and I&#8217;ll
only just be a disgrace to you. I&#8217;d rather go back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
to Cape Cod, and go out to work, and stand
Albertina and everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think it&#8217;s the square thing to do,&#8221; David
said slowly, &#8220;you may go, Eleanor. I&#8217;ll take you
to New York to-morrow and get one of the girls
to take you to Colhassett. Of course, if you do
that it will put me in rather an awkward position.
The others have all had you for two months and
made good on the proposition. I shall have to
admit that I couldn&#8217;t even keep you with me
twenty-four hours. Peter and Jimmie got along
all right, but I couldn&#8217;t handle you at all. As a
cooperative parent, I&#8217;m such a failure that the
whole experiment goes to pieces through me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you&mdash;her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s the same thing,&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t stand
the surroundings I brought you to. You couldn&#8217;t
even be polite to my mother for my sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;never thought of that, Uncle David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it now for a few minutes, won&#8217;t you,
Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>The rain was beginning to lash the windows,
and to sweep the lawn in long slant strokes. The
little girl held up her face as if it could beat
through the panes on it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;that after
Albertina I wouldn&#8217;t <i>take</i> anything from anybody.
Uncle Peter says that I&#8217;m just as good as anybody,
even if I have been out to work. He said
that all I had to do was just to stand up to
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a good many different ways of
standing up to people, Eleanor. Be sure you&#8217;ve
got the right way and then go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I ought to have been politer,&#8221; Eleanor
said slowly. &#8220;I ought to have thought that she
was your own mother. You couldn&#8217;t help the
way she acted, o&#8217; course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way you acted is the point, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll act different if you want me to, Uncle
David,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I won&#8217;t go and leave you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my brave girl. I don&#8217;t think that I
altogether cover myself with glory in an interview
with my mother,&#8221; he added. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t the
thing that I&#8217;m best at, I admit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did pretty good,&#8221; Eleanor consoled him.
&#8220;I guess she makes you kind of bashful the way
she does me,&#8221; from which David gathered with
an odd sense of shock that Eleanor felt there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
something to criticize in his conduct, if she had
permitted herself to look for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; Eleanor decided dreamily
with her nose against the pane. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just
pretend that she&#8217;s Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel&#8217;s aunt, and then
whatever she does, I shan&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ll know that
I&#8217;m the strongest and could hit her if I had a
mind to, and then I shan&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>David contemplated her gravely for several
seconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time you grow up, Eleanor,&#8221; he said
finally, &#8220;you will have developed all your cooperative
parents into fine strong characters. Your
educational methods are wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;The dog got nearly drownded today in the
founting,&#8221; Eleanor wrote. &#8220;It is a very little dog
about the size of Gwendolyn. It was out with
Mademoiselle, and so was I, learning French on
a garden seat. It teetered around on the edge of
the big wash basin&mdash;the founting looks like a
wash basin, and suddenly it fell in. I waded right
in and got it, but it slipped around so I couldn&#8217;t
get it right away. It looked almost too dead to
come to again, but I gave it first aid to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
drownded the way Uncle Jimmie taught me to
practicing on Gwendolyn. When I got it fixed I
looked up and saw Uncle David&#8217;s mother coming.
I took the dog and gave it to her. I said, &#8216;Madam,
here&#8217;s your dog.&#8217; Mademoiselle ran around ringing
her hands and talking about it. Then I went
up to Mrs. Bolling&#8217;s room, and we talked. I told
her how to make mustard pickles, and how my
mother&#8217;s grandpa&#8217;s relation came over in the Mayflower,
and about our single white lilac bush, and
she&#8217;s going to get one and make the pickles. Then
I played double Canfield with her for a while.
I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t go home before I knew her
better. When she acts like Mrs. O&#8217;Farrel&#8217;s aunt
I pretend she is her, and we don&#8217;t quarrel. She
says does Uncle David go much to see Aunt
Beulah, and I say, not so often as Uncle Jimmie
does. Then she says does he go to see Aunt
Margaret, and I say that he goes to see Uncle
Peter the most. Well, if he doesn&#8217;t he almost
does. You can&#8217;t tell Mrs. Madam Bolling that
you won&#8217;t tattle, because she would think the
worst.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Eleanor grew to like Mademoiselle. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
the aging, rather wry faced Frenchwoman who
had been David&#8217;s young brother&#8217;s governess and
had made herself so useful to Mrs. Bolling that
she was kept always on the place, half companion
and half resident housekeeper. She was glad to
have a child in charge again, and Eleanor soon
found that her crooked features and severe high-shouldered
back that had somewhat intimidated
her at first, actually belonged to one of the kindest
hearted creatures in the world.</p>
<p>Paris and Colhassett bore very little resemblance
to each other, the two discovered. To be sure
there were red geraniums every alternating year
in the gardens of the Louvre, and every year in
front of the Sunshine Library in Colhassett. The
residents of both places did a great deal of driving
in fine weather. In Colhassett they drove on
the state highway, recently macadamized to the
dismay of the taxpayers who did not own horses
or automobiles. In Paris they drove out to the
Bois by way of the Champs Elysees. In Colhassett
they had only one ice-cream saloon, but in Paris
they had a good many of them out-of-doors in
the parks and even on the sidewalk, and there
you could buy all kinds of sirups and &#8216;what you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
call cordials&#8217; and <i>aperitifs</i>; but the two places on
the whole were quite different. The people were
different, too. The people of Colhassett were all
religious and thought it was sinful to play cards
on Sundays. Mademoiselle said she always felt
wicked when she played them on a week day.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of my mother,&#8221; she said; &#8220;she would
say &#8216;Juliette, what will you say to the Lord when
he knows that you have been playing cards on a
working day. Playing cards is for Sunday.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord that they have in Colhassett is not
like that,&#8221; Eleanor stated without conscious irreverence.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a vary fonny child, madam,&#8221; Mademoiselle
answered Mrs. Bolling&#8217;s inquiry. &#8220;She has
taste, but no&mdash;experience even of the most
ordinary. She cooks, but she does no embroidery.
She knits and knows no games to play. She has
a good brain, but Mon Dieu, no one has taught
her to ask questions with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has had lessons this year from some young
Rogers graduates, very intelligent girls. I should
think a year of that kind of training would have
had its effect.&#8221; Mrs. Bolling&#8217;s finger went into
every pie in her vicinity with unfailing direction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lessons, yes, but no teaching. If she were not
vary intelligent I think she would have suffered
for it. The public schools they did somesing, but
so little to elevate&mdash;to encourage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus in a breath were Beulah&#8217;s efforts as an
educator disposed of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to undertake the teaching of
that child for a year?&#8221; Mrs. Bolling asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! but yes, madam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll make the offer to David.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bolling was unsympathetic but she was
thorough. She liked to see things properly done.
Since David and his young friends had undertaken
a venture so absurd, she decided to lend
them a helping hand with it. Besides, now that
she had no children of her own in the house,
Mademoiselle was practically eating her head off.
Also it had developed that David was fond of the
child, so fond of her that to oppose that affection
would have been bad policy, and Mrs. Bolling was
politic when she chose to be. She chose to be
politic now, for sometime during the season she
was going to ask a very great favor of David,
and she hoped, that by first being extraordinarily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
complaisant and kind and then by bringing considerable
pressure to bear upon him, he would
finally do what he was asked. The favor was to
provide himself with a father-in-law, and that
father-in-law the multi-millionaire parent of the
raven-haired, crafty-eyed ing&eacute;nue, who had begun
angling for him that June night at the country
club.</p>
<p>She made the suggestion to David on the eve
of the arrival of all of Eleanor&#8217;s guardians for
the week-end. Mrs. Bolling had invited a house-party
comprised of the associated parents as a
part of her policy of kindness before the actual
summoning of her forces for the campaign she
was about to inaugurate.</p>
<p>David was really touched by his mother&#8217;s generosity
concerning Eleanor. He had been agreeably
surprised at the development of the situation
between the child and his mother. He had been
obliged to go into town the day after Eleanor&#8217;s
first unfortunate encounter with her hostess, and
had hurried home in fear and trembling to try
to smooth out any tangles in the skein of their
relationship that might have resulted from a day
in each other&#8217;s vicinity. After hurrying over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
house and through the grounds in search of her
he finally discovered the child companionably currying
a damp and afflicted Pekinese in his mother&#8217;s
sitting-room, and engaged in a grave discussion
of the relative merits of molasses and sugar as a
sweetening for Boston baked beans.</p>
<p>It was while they were having their after-dinner
coffee in the library, for which Eleanor had been
allowed to come down, though nursery supper
was the order of the day in the Bolling establishment,
that David told his friends of his mother&#8217;s
offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we decided to send her to school
when she was twelve anyway,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
idea was to keep her among ourselves for two
years to establish the parental tie, or ties I should
say. If she is quartered here with Mademoiselle
we could still keep in touch with her and she
would be having the advantage of a year&#8217;s steady
tuition under one person, and we&#8217;d be relieved&mdash;&#8221;
a warning glance from Margaret, with an almost
imperceptible inclination of her head in the
direction of Beulah, caused him to modify the
end of his sentence&mdash;&#8220;of the responsibility&mdash;for her
physical welfare.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mentally and morally,&#8221; Gertrude cut in, &#8220;the
bunch would still supervise her entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie, who was sitting beside her, ran his
arm along the back of her chair affectionately, and
then thought better of it and drew it away. He
was, for some unaccountable reason, feeling
awkward and not like himself. There was a girl
in New York, with whom he was not in the least
in love, who had recently taken it upon herself
to demonstrate unmistakably that she was not in
love with him. There was another girl who insisted
on his writing her every day. Here was
Gertrude, who never had any time for him any
more, absolutely without enthusiasm at his proximity.
He thought it would be a good idea to allow
Eleanor to remain where she was and said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I won&#8217;t miss the jolly times we had
together, Babe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was planning some
real rackets this year,&mdash;to make up for what I
put you through,&#8221; he added in her ear, as she
came and stood beside him for a minute.</p>
<p>Gertrude wanted to go abroad for a year, &#8220;and
lick her wounds,&#8221; as she told herself. She would
have come back for her two months with Eleanor,
but she was glad to be relieved of that necessity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
Margaret had the secret feeling that the ordeal
of the Hutchinsons was one that she would like
to spare her foster child, and incidentally herself
in relation to the adjustment of conditions necessary
to Eleanor&#8217;s visit. Peter wanted her with
him, but he believed the new arrangement would
be better for the child. Beulah alone held out
for her rights and her parental privileges. The
decision was finally left to Eleanor.</p>
<p>She stood in the center of the group a little
forlornly while they awaited her word. A wave
of her old shyness overtook her and she blushed
hot and crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all in your own hands, dear,&#8221; Beulah said
briskly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor kiddie,&#8221; Gertrude thought, &#8220;it&#8217;s all wrong
somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you want me to say,&#8221;
Eleanor said piteously and sped to the haven of
Peter&#8217;s breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll manage a month together anyway,&#8221;
Peter whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I guess I&#8217;ll stay here,&#8221; she whispered
back, &#8220;because next I would have to go to Aunt
Beulah&#8217;s.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>Peter, turning involuntarily in Beulah&#8217;s direction,
saw the look of chagrin and disappointment
on her face, and realized how much she minded
playing a losing part in the game and yet how
well she was doing it. &#8220;She&#8217;s only a straight-laced
kid after all,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;She&#8217;s put her whole
heart and soul into this thing. There&#8217;s a look
about the top part of her face when it&#8217;s softened
that&#8217;s a little like Ellen&#8217;s.&#8221; Ellen was his dead
fianc&eacute;e&mdash;the girl in the photograph at home in
his desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll stay here,&#8221; Eleanor said aloud, &#8220;all
in one place, and study with Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a decision that, on the whole, she never
regretted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good plan to put a quotation like
Kipling at the top of the page whenever I write
anything in this diary,&#8221; Eleanor began in the
smart leather bound book with her initials stamped
in black on the red cover&mdash;the new private diary
that had been Peter&#8217;s gift to her on the occasion
of her fifteenth birthday some months before. &#8220;I
think it is a very expressive thing to do. The
quotation above is one that expresses me, and I
think it is beautiful too. Miss Hadley&mdash;that&#8217;s my
English teacher&mdash;the girls call her Haddock because
she does look rather like a fish&mdash;says that
it&#8217;s undoubtedly one of the most poignant descriptions
of adolescent womanhood ever made. I
made a note to look up adolescent, but didn&#8217;t.

to feel that way, but she never will. Good old

<p>&#8220;Well, I hardly know where to begin. I
thought I would make a resum&eacute; of some of the
events of the last year. I was only fourteen then,
but still I did a great many things that might be
of interest to me in my declining years when I
look back into the annals of this book. To begin
with I was only a freshie at Harmon. It is very
different to be a sophomore. I can hardly believe
that I was once a shivering looking little thing
like all the freshmen that came in this year. I
was very frightened, but did not think I showed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Burns had twins and a rather bad
character, but after he met his bonnie Jean he
wrote very beautiful poetry. A poet&#8217;s life is
usually sad anyhow&mdash;full of disappointment and
pain&mdash;but I digress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had two years with Mademoiselle at the
Bollings&#8217; instead of one the way we planned. I
haven&#8217;t written in my Private Diary since the
night of that momentous decision that I was to
stay in one place instead of taking turns visiting
my cooperative parents. I went to another school
one year before I came to Harmon, and that
brings me to the threshold of my fourteenth year.
If I try to go back any farther, I&#8217;ll never catch up.
I spent that vacation with Aunt Margaret in a
cottage on Long Island with her sister, and her
sister&#8217;s boy, who has grown up to be the silly
kind that wants to kiss you and pull your hair,
and those things. Aunt Margaret is so lovely I
can&#8217;t think of words to express it. &#8216;Oh! rare pale
Margaret,&#8217; as Tennyson says. She wears her hair
in a coronet braid around the top of her head,
and all her clothes are the color of violets or a
soft dovey gray or white, though baby blue looks
nice on her especially when she wears a fishyou.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I went down to Cape Cod for a week before
I came to Harmon, and while I was there my
grandmother died. I can&#8217;t write about that in
this diary. I loved my grandmother and my grandmother
loved me. Uncle Peter came, and took charge
of everything. He has great strength that holds
you up in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first day I came to Harmon I saw the
girl I wanted for my best friend, and so we
roomed together, and have done so ever since.
Her name is Margaret Louise Hodges, but she
is called Maggie Lou by every one. She has dark
curly hair, and deep brown eyes, and a very
silvery voice. I have found out that she lies
some, but she says it is because she had such an
unhappy childhood, and has promised to overcome
it for my sake.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Christmas vacation the &#8216;We Are Sevens&#8217;
went up the Hudson to the Bollings&#8217; again, but
that was the last time they ever went there. Uncle
David and his mother had a terrible fight over
them. I was sorry for Madam Bolling in a way.
There was a girl she wanted Uncle David to
marry, a rich girl who looked something like
Cleopatra, very dark complexioned with burning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
eyes. She had a sweet little Pekinese something
like Zaidee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle David said that gold could never buy
him, and to take her away, but Madam Bolling
was very angry, of course. She accused him of
wanting to marry Aunt Margaret, and called her
a characterless, faded blonde. Then it was Uncle
David&#8217;s turn to get angry, and I have never seen
any one get any angrier, and he told about the
vow of celibacy, and how instead of having designs
on him the whole crowd would back him up
in his struggle to stay single. It was an awful
row. I told Madam Bolling that I would help
her to get Uncle David back, and I did, but she
never forgave the other aunts and uncles. I suppose
the feelings of a mother would prompt her
to want Uncle David settled down with a rich and
fashionable girl who would soon be the mother
of a lot of lovely children. I can&#8217;t imagine a
Cleopatra looking baby, but she might have boys
that looked like Uncle David.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vacations are really about all there is to
school. Freshman year is mostly grinding and
stuffing. Having six parents to send you boxes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
of &#8216;grub&#8217; is better than having only two. Some
of the girls are rather selfish about the eats, and
come in and help themselves boldly when you are
out of the room. Maggie Lou puts up signs over
the candy box: &#8216;Closed for Repairs,&#8217; or &#8216;No Trespassing
by Order of the Board of Health,&#8217; but
they don&#8217;t pay much attention. Well, last summer
vacation I spent with Uncle Jimmie. I wouldn&#8217;t
tell this, but I reformed him. I made him sign
the pledge. I don&#8217;t know what pledge it was because
I didn&#8217;t read it, but he said he was addicted
to something worse than anything I could think
of, and if somebody didn&#8217;t pull him up, he
wouldn&#8217;t answer for the consequences. I asked
him why he didn&#8217;t choose Aunt Gertrude to do it,
and he groaned only. So I said to write out a
pledge, and sign it and I would be the witness.
We were at a hotel with his brother&#8217;s family. It
isn&#8217;t proper any more for me to go around with
my uncles unless I have a chaperon. Mademoiselle
says that I oughtn&#8217;t even to go down-town
alone with them but, of course, that is French
etiquette, and not American. Well, there were
lots of pretty girls at this hotel, all wearing white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
and pink dresses, and carrying big bell shaped
parasols of bright colors. They looked sweet,
like so many flowers, but Uncle Jimmie just about
hated the sight of them. He said they were not
girls at all, but just pink and white devices of
the devil. On the whole he didn&#8217;t act much like
my merry uncle, but we had good times together
playing tennis and golf, and going on parties with
his brother&#8217;s family, all mere children but the
mother and father. Uncle Jimmie was afraid to
go and get his mail all summer, although he had
a great many letters on blue and lavender note
paper scented with Roger et Gallet&#8217;s violet, and
Hudnut&#8217;s carnation. We used to go down to the
beach and make bonfires and burn them unread,
and then toast marshmallows in their ashes. He
said that they were communications from the
spirits of the dead. I should have thought that
they were from different girls, but he seemed to
hate the sight of girls so much. Once I asked
him if he had ever had an unhappy love-affair,
just to see what he would say, but he replied &#8216;no,
they had all been happy ones,&#8217; and groaned and
groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Beulah has changed too. She has become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
a suffragette and thinks only of getting
women their rights and their privileges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maggie Lou is an anti, and we have long arguments
about the cause. She says that woman&#8217;s
place is in the home, but I say look at me, who
have no home, how can I wash and bake and
brew like the women of my grandfather&#8217;s day,
visiting around the way I do? And she says that
it is the principle of the thing that is involved,
and I ought to take a stand for or against. Everybody
has so many different arguments that I don&#8217;t
know what I think yet, but some day I shall make
up my mind for good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that about brings me up to the present.
I meant to describe a few things in detail, but I
guess I will not begin on the past in that way. I
don&#8217;t get so awfully much time to write in this
diary because of the many interruptions of school
life, and the way the monitors snoop in study
hours. I don&#8217;t know who I am going to spend
my Christmas holidays with. I sent Uncle Peter
a poem three days ago, but he has not answered it
yet. I&#8217;m afraid he thought it was very silly. I
don&#8217;t hardly know what it means myself. It goes
as follows:

<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Merry Christmas</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Margaret in mauve velvet and violets,
and Gertrude in a frock of smart black
and white were in the act of meeting by appointment
at Sherry&#8217;s one December afternoon, with
a comfortable cup of tea in mind. Gertrude
emerged from the recess of the revolving door
and Margaret, sitting eagerly by the entrance,
almost upset the attendant in her rush to her
friend&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Gertrude,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad to see
you. My family is trying to cut me up in neat
little quarters and send me north, south, east and
west, for the Christmas holidays, and I want to
stay home and have Eleanor. How did I ever
come to be born into a family of giants, tell me
that, Gertrude?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The choice of parents is thrust upon us at an
unfortunately immature period, I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; Gertrude
laughed. &#8220;My parents are dears, but they&#8217;ve
never forgiven me for being an artist instead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
a dubby bud. Shall we have tea right away or
shall we sit down and discuss life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know which
is the hungrier&mdash;flesh or spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as they turned toward the dining-room a
familiar figure blocked their progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that was Gertrude&#8217;s insatiable hat,&#8221;
David exclaimed delightedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve phoned for
you both until your families have given instructions
that I&#8217;m not to be indulged any more. I&#8217;ve
got a surprise for you.&mdash;Taxi,&#8221; he said to the
man at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till we&#8217;ve had our tea,&#8221; Margaret wailed.
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t be so cruel, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall have your tea, my dear, and one of
the happiest surprises of your life into the bargain,&#8221;
David assured her as he led the way to the
waiting cab.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t leave this place unfed for anybody
but you, David, not if it were ever so, and then
some, as Jimmie says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Jimmie, anyhow?&#8221;
David inquired as the taxi turned down the
Avenue and immediately entangled itself in a
hopeless mesh of traffic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know; why?&#8221; Gertrude answered,
though she had not been the one addressed at the
moment. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with this hat?&#8221; she
rattled on without waiting for an answer. &#8220;I
thought it was good-looking myself, and Madam
Paran robbed me for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is good-looking,&#8221; David allowed. &#8220;It seems
to be a kind of retrieving hat, that&#8217;s all. Keeps
you in a rather constant state of looking after the
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about my hat, David?&#8221; Margaret inquired
anxiously. &#8220;Do you like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; David admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m crazy about it.
It&#8217;s a lovely cross between the style affected by
the late Emperor Napoleon and my august grandmother,
with some frills added.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chauffeur turned into a cross street and
stopped abruptly before an imposing but apparently
unguarded entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought this was a studio building,&#8221;
Gertrude said. &#8220;David, if you&#8217;re springing a tea
party on us, and we in the wild ungovernable
state we are at present, I&#8217;ll shoot the way my hat
is pointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight through my left eye-glass,&#8221; David
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
finished. &#8220;You wait till you see the injustice you
have done me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Margaret, who often understood what was
happening a few moments before the revelation of
it, clutched at his elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! David, David,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;how
wonderful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you see,&#8221; David said, and herded
them into the elevator.</p>
<p>Their destination was the top floor but one.
David hurried them around the bend in the sleekly
carpeted corridor and touched the bell on the
right of the first door they came to. It opened
almost instantly and David&#8217;s man, who was French,
stood bowing and smiling on the threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Styvvisont has arrive&#8217;,&#8221; he said; &#8220;he waits
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to our city,&#8221; Peter cried, appearing
in the doorway of the room Alphonse was indicating
with that high gesture of delight with
which only a Frenchman can lead the way.
&#8220;Jimmie&#8217;s coming up from the office and Beulah&#8217;s
due any minute. What do you think of the place,
girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it really yours, David?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know.&#8221; He grinned like a
schoolboy. &#8220;It&#8217;s really ours, that&#8217;s what it is.
I&#8217;ve broken away from the mater at last,&#8221; he
added a little sheepishly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to work
seriously. I&#8217;ve got an all-day desk job in my
uncle&#8217;s office and I&#8217;m going to dig in and see what
I can make of myself. Also, this is going to be
our headquarters, and Eleanor&#8217;s permanent home
if we&#8217;re all agreed upon it,&mdash;but look around,
ladies. Don&#8217;t spare my blushes. If you think I
can interior decorate, just tell me so frankly. This
is the living-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like that old conundrum&mdash;black and white
and red all over,&#8221; Gertrude said. &#8220;I never saw
anything so stunning in all my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! I admire your nerve,&#8221; Peter cried,
&#8220;papering this place in white, and then getting in
all this heavy carved black stuff, and the red in
the tapestries and screens and pillows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted it to look studioish a little,&#8221; David
explained, &#8220;I wanted to get away from Louis
Quartorze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And drawing-rooms like mother used to make,&#8221;
Gertrude suggested. &#8220;I like your Oriental touches.
Do you see, Margaret, everything is Indian or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Chinese? The ubiquitous Japanese print is conspicuous
by its absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got two portfolios full of &#8217;em,&#8221; David
said, &#8220;and I always have one or two up in the
bedrooms. I change &#8217;em around, you know, the
way the Japs do themselves, a different scene
every few days and the rest decently out of sight
till you&#8217;re ready for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a fairy story,&#8221; Margaret said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d appreciate what little Arabian
Nights I was able to introduce. I bought that
screen,&#8221; he indicated a sweep of Chinese line and
color, &#8220;with my eye on you, and that Aladdin&#8217;s
lamp is yours, of course. You&#8217;re to come in here
and rub it whenever you like, and your heart&#8217;s
desire will instantly be vouchsafed to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will Eleanor say?&#8221; Peter suggested, as
David led the way through the corridor and up
the tiny stairs which led to the more intricate
part of the establishment. &#8220;This is her room,
didn&#8217;t you say, David?&#8221; He paused on the
threshold of a bedroom done in ivory white and
yellow, with all its hangings of a soft golden silk.</p>
<p>&#8220;She once said that she wanted a yellow room,&#8221;
David said, &#8220;a daffy-down-dilly room, and I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
tried to get her one. I know last year that Maggie
Lou child refused to have yellow curtains in that
flatiron shaped sitting-room of theirs, and Eleanor
refused to be comforted.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wild whoop in the below stairs announced
Jimmie; and Beulah arrived simultaneously with
the tea tray. Jimmie was ecstatic when the actual
function of the place was explained to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Headquarters is the one thing we&#8217;ve lacked,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;a place of our own, hully gee! It makes
me feel almost human again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t been feeling altogether human
lately, have you, Jimmie?&#8221; Margaret asked over
her tea cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear, I haven&#8217;t.&#8221; Jimmie flashed her a
grateful smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bad egg,&#8221; he explained to
her darkly, &#8220;and the only thing you can do with
me is to scramble me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scrambled is just about the way I should have
described your behavior of late,&mdash;but that&#8217;s Gertrude&#8217;s
line,&#8221; David said. &#8220;Only she doesn&#8217;t seem
to be taking an active part in the conversation.
Aren&#8217;t you Jimmie&#8217;s keeper any more, Gertrude?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since she&#8217;s come back from abroad,&#8221; Jimmie
muttered without looking at her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor&#8217;s taken the job over now,&#8221; Peter said.
&#8220;She&#8217;s made him swear off red ink and red
neckties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any color so long&#8217;s it&#8217;s red is the color that
suits me best,&#8221; Jimmie quoted. &#8220;Lord, isn&#8217;t this
room a pippin?&#8221; He swam in among the bright
pillows of the divan and so hid his face for a
moment. It had been a good many weeks since
he had seen Gertrude.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to give a suffrage tea here,&#8221; Beulah
broke in suddenly. &#8220;It&#8217;s so central, but I don&#8217;t
suppose David would hear of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us&mdash;&#8221;
Peter began.</p>
<p>&#8220;My <i>mother</i> would hear of it,&#8221; David said, &#8220;and
then there wouldn&#8217;t be any little studio any more.
She doesn&#8217;t believe in votes for women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How any woman in this day and age&mdash;&#8221;
Beulah began, and thought better of it, since she
was discussing Mrs. Bolling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes your blood boil, doesn&#8217;t it&mdash;Beulahland?&#8221;
Gertrude suggested helpfully, reaching for
the tea cakes. &#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;ll vote for women.
I&#8217;ll march in your old peerade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord helps those that help themselves,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Peter said, &#8220;that&#8217;s why Gertrude is a suffragist.
She believes in helping herself, in every sense,
don&#8217;t you, &#8217;Trude?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite in every sense,&#8221; Gertrude said gravely.
&#8220;Sometimes I feel like that girl that Margaret
describes as caught in a horrid way between two
generations. I&#8217;m neither old-fashioned nor
modern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather be that way than early Victorian,&#8221;
Margaret sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of the latest generation, has anybody
any objection to having our child here for
the holidays?&#8221; David asked. &#8220;My idea is to have
one grand Christmas dinner. I suppose we&#8217;ll all
have to eat one meal with our respective families,
but can&#8217;t we manage to get together here for dinner
at night? Don&#8217;t you think that we could?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t, but we will,&#8221; Margaret murmured.
&#8220;Of course, have Eleanor here. I wanted her
with me but the family thought otherwise. They&#8217;ve
been trying to send me away for my health,
David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they shan&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll stay in New York
for your health and come to my party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret&#8217;s health is merely a matter of Margaret&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
happiness anyhow. Her soul and her body
are all one,&#8221; Gertrude said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then cursed be he who brings anything but
happiness to Margaret,&#8221; Peter said, to which
sentiment David added a solemn &#8220;Amen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Margaret said, shivering
a little, &#8220;I feel as if some one were&mdash;were&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trampling the violets on your grave,&#8221; Gertrude
finished for her.</p>
<p>Christmas that year fell on a Monday, and
Eleanor did not leave school till the Friday before
the great day. Owing to the exigencies of the
holiday season none of her guardians came to see
her before the dinner party itself. Even David
was busy with his mother&mdash;installed now for a
few weeks in the hotel suite that would be her
home until the opening of the season at Palm
Beach&mdash;and had only a few hurried words with
her. Mademoiselle, whom he had imported for
the occasion, met her at the station and helped her
to do her modest shopping which consisted chiefly
of gifts for her beloved aunts and uncles. She
had arranged these things lovingly at their plates,
and fled to dress when they began to assemble for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the celebration. The girls were the first arrivals.
Then Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s our child, David?&#8221; Gertrude asked. &#8220;I
had a few minutes&#8217; talk with her over the telephone
and she seemed to be flourishing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is,&#8221; David answered. &#8220;She&#8217;s grown several
feet since we last saw her. They&#8217;ve been
giving scenes from Shakespeare at school and
she&#8217;s been playing Juliet, it appears. She has
had a fight with another girl about suffrage&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know which side she was on, Beulah, I am
merely giving you the facts as they came to me&mdash;and
the other girl was so unpleasant about it that
she has been visited by just retribution in the form
of the mumps, and had to be sent home and
quarantined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds a bit priggish,&#8221; Peter suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really,&#8221; David said, &#8220;she&#8217;s as sound as a
nut. She&#8217;s only going through the different stages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To pass deliberately through one&#8217;s ages,&#8221;
Beulah quoted, &#8220;is to get the heart out of a liberal
education.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Beulah,&#8221; Gertrude cried, &#8220;you&#8217;re quite
in your old form to-night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is she just the same little girl, David?&#8221; Margaret
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same. She really seems younger than
ever. I don&#8217;t know why she doesn&#8217;t come down.
There she is, I guess. No, it&#8217;s only Alphonse
letting in Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie, whose spirits seemed to have revived
under the holiday influence, was staggering under
the weight of his parcels. The Christmas presents
had already accumulated to a considerable mound
on the couch. Margaret was brooding over them
and trying not to look greedy. She was still
very much of a child herself in relation to Santa
Claus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merry Christmas!&#8221; Jimmie cried. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
my child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming,&#8221; David said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the candy kids. My eyes&mdash;but you&#8217;re
a slick trio, girls. Pale lavender, pale blue, and
pale pink, and all quite sophisticatedly d&eacute;collet&eacute;.
You go with the decorations, too. I don&#8217;t know
quite why you do, but you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give honor where honor is due, dearie. That&#8217;s
owing to the cleverness of the decorator,&#8221; David
said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No man calls me dearie and lives to tell the
tale,&#8221; Jimmie remarked almost dreamily as he
squared off. &#8220;How&#8217;ll you have it, Dave?&#8221;</p>
<p>But at that instant there was an unexpected interruption.
Alphonse threw open the big entrance
door at the farther end of the long room with a
flourish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle Juliet Capulet,&#8221; he proclaimed
with the grand air, and then retired behind his
hand, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Framed in the high doorway, complete, cap and
curls, softly rounding bodice, and the long, straight
lines of the Renaissance, stood Juliet&mdash;Juliet, immemorial,
immortal, young&mdash;austerely innocent
and delicately shy, already beautiful, and yet
potential of all the beauty and the wisdom of the
world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never worn these clothes before anybody
but the girls before,&#8221; Eleanor said, &#8220;but I
thought&#8221;&mdash;she looked about her appealingly&mdash;&#8220;you
might like it&mdash;for a surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great jumping Jehoshaphat,&#8221; Jimmie exclaimed,
&#8220;I thought you said she was the same little girl,
David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was half an hour ago,&#8221; David answered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
&#8220;I never saw such a metamorphosis. In fact, I
don&#8217;t think I ever saw Juliet before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is the thing itself,&#8221; Gertrude answered,
the artist in her sobered by the vision.</p>
<p>But Peter passed a dazed hand over his eyes
and stared at the delicate figure advancing to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! she&#8217;s a woman,&#8221; he said, and drew
the hard breath of a man just awakened from
sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Growing Up</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dear Uncle Jimmie:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a pleasant surprise to get letters
from every one of my uncles the first week I got
back to school. It was unprecedented. You wrote
me two letters last year, Uncle David six, and
Uncle Peter sixteen. He is the best correspondent,
but perhaps that is because I ask him the most
advice. The Christmas party was lovely. I shall
never forget the expressions on all the different
faces when I came down in my Juliet suit. I
thought at first that no one liked me in it, but I
guess they did.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know how well I liked my presents because
you heard my wild exclamations of delight. I
never had such a nice Christmas. It was sweet
of the We Are Sevens to get me that ivory set,
and to know that every different piece was the
loving thought of a different aunt or uncle. I
love the yellow monogram. It looks entirely
unique, and I like to have things that are not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
like anybody else&#8217;s in the world, don&#8217;t you, Uncle
Jimmie? I am glad you liked your cuff links.
They are &#8216;neat,&#8217; but not &#8216;gaudy.&#8217; You play golf
so well I thought a golf stick was a nice emblem
for you, and would remind you of me and last
summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad you think it is easier to keep your
pledge now. I made a New Year&#8217;s resolution to
go without chocolates, and give the money they
would cost to some good cause, but it&#8217;s hard to
pick out a cause, or to decide exactly how much
money you are saving. I can eat the chocolates
that are sent to me, however!!!!</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle David said that he thought you were
not like yourself lately, but you seemed just the
same to me Christmas, only more affectionate. I
love you very much. I was really only joking
about the chocolates. Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Dear Uncle David:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was glad to get your nice letter. You did
not have to write in response to my bread and
butter letter, but I am glad you did. When I am
at school, and getting letters all the time I feel as
if I were living two beautiful lives all at once, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
life of a &#8216;cooperative child&#8217; and the life of
Eleanor Hamlin, schoolgirl, both together. Letters
make the people you love seem very near to
you, don&#8217;t you think they do? I sleep with all
my letters under my pillow whenever I feel the
least little bit homesick, and they almost seem to
breathe sometimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;School is the same old school. Maggie Lou
had a wrist watch, too, for Christmas, but not so
pretty as the one you gave me. Miss Hadley says
I do remarkable work in English whenever I feel
like it. I don&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s a compliment
or not. I took Kris Kringle for the subject of a
theme the other day, and represented him as caught
in an iceberg in the grim north, and not being
able to reach all the poor little children in the
tenements and hovels. The Haddock said it
showed imagination.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a lecture at school on Emerson the
other day. The speaker was a noted literary
lecturer from New York. He had wonderful
waving hair, more like Pader&mdash;I can&#8217;t spell him,
but you know who I mean&mdash;than Uncle Jimmie&#8217;s,
but a little like both. He introduced some very
noble thoughts in his discourse, putting perfectly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
old ideas in a new way that made you think a lot
more of them. I think a tall man like that with
waving hair can do a great deal of good as a
lecturer, because you listen a good deal more respectfully
than if they were plain looking. His
voice sounded a good deal like what I imagine
Romeo&#8217;s voice did. I had a nice letter from
Madam Bolling. I love you, and I have come to
the bottom of the sheet. Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Dear Uncle Peter:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just written to my other uncles, so I
won&#8217;t write you a long letter this time. They
deserve letters because of being so unusually
prompt after the holidays. You always deserve
letters, but not specially now, any more than any
other time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter, I wrote to my grandfather. It
seems funny to think of Albertina&#8217;s aunt taking
care of him now that Grandma is gone. I suppose
Albertina is there a lot. She sent me a post
card for Christmas. I didn&#8217;t send her any.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter, I miss my grandmother out of the
world. I remember how I used to take care of
her, and put a soapstone in the small of her back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
when she was cold. I wish sometimes that I could
hold your hand, Uncle Peter, when I get thinking
about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, school is the same old school. Bertha
Stephens has a felon on her finger, and that lets
her out of hard work for a while. I will enclose
a poem suggested by a lecture I heard recently on
Emerson. It isn&#8217;t very good, but it will help to
fill up the envelope. I love you, and love you.
Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;P. S. I haven&#8217;t got the last verse very good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
yet, but I think the second one is pretty. You
know &#8216;love-lies-bleeding&#8217; is a flower, but it
sounds allegorical the way I have put it in. Don&#8217;t
you think so? You know what all the crosses

<hr class='mini' />
<p>Eleanor&#8217;s fifteenth year was on the whole the
least eventful year of her life, though not by any
means the least happy. She throve exceedingly,
and gained the freedom and poise of movement
and spontaneity that result from properly balanced
periods of work and play and healthful exercise.
From being rather small of her age she developed
into a tall slender creature, inherently graceful and
erect, with a small, delicate head set flower-wise
on a slim white neck. Gertrude never tired of
modeling that lovely contour, but Eleanor herself
was quite unconscious of her natural advantages.
She preferred the snappy-eyed, stocky, ringleted
type of beauty, and spent many unhappy quarters
of an hour wishing she were pretty according to
the inexorable ideals of Harmon.</p>
<p>She spent her vacation at David&#8217;s apartment in
charge of Mademoiselle, though the latter part of
the summer she went to Colhassett, quite by herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
according to her own desire, and spent a
month with her grandfather, now in charge of
Albertina&#8217;s aunt. She found Albertina grown into
a huge girl, sunk in depths of sloth and snobbishness,
who plied her with endless questions concerning
life in the gilded circles of New York
society. Eleanor found her disgusting and yet
possessed of that vague fascination that the assumption
of prerogative often carries with it.</p>
<p>She found her grandfather very old and
shrunken, yet perfectly taken care of and with
every material want supplied. She realized as
she had never done before how the faithful six
had assumed the responsibility of this household
from the beginning, and how the old people had
been warmed and comforted by their bounty. She
laughed to remember her simplicity in believing that
an actual salary was a perquisite of her adoption,
and understood for the first time how small a
part of the expense of their living this faithful
stipend had defrayed. She looked back incredulously
on that period when she had lived with
them in a state of semi-starvation on the corn
meal and cereals and very little else that her
dollar and a half a week had purchased, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
&#8220;garden sass,&#8221; that her grandfather had faithfully
hoed and tended in the straggling patch of
plowed field that he would hoe and tend no
more. She spent a month practically at his feet,
listening to his stories, helping him to find his
pipe and tobacco and glasses, and reading the
newspaper to him, and felt amply rewarded by his
final acknowledgment that she was a good girl
and he would as soon have her come again whenever
she felt like it.</p>
<p>On her way back to school she spent a week
with her friend, Margaret Louise, in the Connecticut
town where she lived with her comfortable,
commonplace family. It was while she
was on this visit that the most significant event of
the entire year took place, though it was a happening
that she put out of her mind as soon as
possible and never thought of it again when she
could possibly avoid it.</p>
<p>Maggie Lou had a brother of seventeen, and
one night in the corner of a moonlit porch, when
they happened to be alone for a half hour, he had
asked Eleanor to kiss him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to kiss you,&#8221; Eleanor said. Then,
not wishing to convey a sense of any personal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
dislike to the brother of a friend to whom she
was so sincerely devoted, she added, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know you well enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was a big boy, with mocking blue eyes and
rough tweed clothes that hung on him loosely.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you know me better, will you let me
kiss you?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Eleanor said, still endeavoring
to preserve the amenities.</p>
<p>He took her hand and played with it softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an awful sweet little girl,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll go in now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit still. Sister&#8217;ll be back in a minute.&#8221; He
pulled her back to the chair from which she had
half arisen. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe in kissing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in kissing <i>you</i>,&#8221; she tried to
say, but the words would not come. She could
only pray for deliverance through the arrival of
some member of the family. The boy&#8217;s face was
close to hers. It looked sweet in the moonlight
she thought. She wished he would talk of something
else besides kissing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like me?&#8221; he persisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; She was very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, there&#8217;s no more to be said.&#8221; His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
lips sought hers and pressed them. His breath
came heavily, with little irregular catches in it.</p>
<p>She pushed him away and turned into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry, Eleanor,&#8221; he pleaded, trying to
snatch at her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not angry,&#8221; she said, her voice breaking,
&#8220;I just wish you hadn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no reference to this incident in the
private diary, but, with an instinct which would
have formed an indissoluble bond between herself
and her Uncle Jimmie, she avoided dimly lit
porches and boys with mischievous eyes and broad
tweed covered shoulders.</p>
<p>For her guardians too, this year was comparatively
smooth running and colorless. Beulah&#8217;s
militant spirit sought the assuagement of a fierce
expenditure of energy on the work that came to
her hand through her new interest in suffrage.
Gertrude flung herself into her sculpturing. She
had been hurt as only the young can be hurt when
their first delicate desires come to naught. She
was very warm-blooded and eager under her cool
veneer, and she had spent four years of hard work
and hungry yearning for the fulness of a life she
was too constrained to get any emotional hold on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
Her fancy for Jimmie she believed was quite over
and done with.</p>
<p>Margaret, warmed by secret fires and nourished
by the stuff that dreams are made of, flourished
strangely in her attic chamber, and learned the
wisdom of life by some curious method of her
own of apprehending its dangers and delights. The
only experiences she had that year were two proposals
of marriage, one from a timid professor of
the romance languages and the other from a young
society man, already losing his waist line, whose
sensuous spirit had been stirred by the ethereal
grace of hers; but these things interested her very
little. She was the princess, spinning fine dreams
and waiting for the dawning of the golden day
when the prince should come for her. Neither
she nor Gertrude ever gave a serious thought to
the five-year-old vow of celibacy, which was to
Beulah as real and as binding as it had seemed on
the first day she took it.</p>
<p>Peter and David and Jimmie went their own
way after the fashion of men, all of them identified
with the quickening romance of New York
business life. David in Wall Street was proving
to be something of a financier to his mother&#8217;s surprise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
and amazement; and the pressure relaxed, he
showed some slight initiative in social matters. In
fact, two mothers, who were on Mrs. Bolling&#8217;s list
as suitable parents-in-law, took heart of grace and
began angling for him adroitly, while their daughters
served him tea and made unabashed, modern-d&eacute;butante
eyes at him.</p>
<p>Jimmie, successfully working his way up to the
top of his firm, suffered intermittently from his
enthusiastic abuse of the privileges of liberty and
the pursuit of happiness. His mind and soul were
in reality hot on the trail of a wife, and there was
no woman among those with whom he habitually
foregathered whom his spirit recognized as his own
woman. He was further rendered helpless and
miserable by the fact that he had not the slightest
idea of his trouble. He regarded himself as a
congenital Don Juan, from whom his better self
shrank at times with a revulsion of loathing.</p>
<p>Peter felt that he had his feet very firmly on a
rather uninspired earth. He was getting on in
the woolen business, which happened to be the
vocation his father had handed down to him. He
belonged to an amusing club, and he still felt himself
irrevocably widowed by the early death of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
girl in the photograph he so faithfully cherished.
Eleanor was a very vital interest in his life. It
had seemed to him for a few minutes at the
Christmas party that she was no longer the little
girl he had known, that a lovelier, more illusive
creature&mdash;a woman&mdash;had come to displace her, but
when she had flung her arms around him he had
realized that it was still the heart of a child beating
so fondly against his own.</p>
<p>The real trouble with arrogating to ourselves
the privileges of parenthood is that our native instincts
are likely to become deflected by the substitution
of the artificial for the natural responsibility.
Both Peter and David had the unconscious
feeling that their obligation to their race was met
by their communal interest in Eleanor. Beulah,
of course, sincerely believed that the filling in of
an intellectual concept of life was all that was required
of her. Only Jimmie groped blindly and bewilderedly
for his own. Gertrude and Margaret
both understood that they were unnaturally alone
in a world where lovers met and mated, but they,
too, hugged to their souls the flattering unction
that they were parents of a sort.</p>
<p>Thus three sets of perfectly suitable and devoted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
young men and women, of marriageable age,
with dozens of interests and sympathies in common,
and one extraordinarily vital bond, continued
to walk side by side in a state of inhuman preoccupation,
their gaze fixed inward instead of upon
one another; and no Divine Power, happening
upon the curious circumstance, believed the matter
one for His intervention nor stooped to take the
respective puppets by the back of their unconscious
necks, and so knock their sluggish heads
together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Margaret Louisa&#8217;s Birthright</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I am sixteen years and eight months old
to-day,&#8221; Eleanor wrote, &#8220;and I have had
the kind of experience that makes me feel as if I
never wanted to be any older. I know life is full
of disillusionment and pain, but I did not know
that any one with whom you have broken bread,
and slept in the same room with, and told everything
to for four long years, could turn out to be
an absolute traitor and villainess. Let me begin
at the beginning. For nearly a year now I have
noticed that Bertha Stephens avoided me, and
presented the appearance of disliking me. I don&#8217;t
like to have any one dislike me, and I have tried
to do little things for her that would win back
her affection, but with no success. As I was
editing the Lantern I could print her essayettes
(as she called them) and do her lots of little
favors in a literary way, which she seemed to appreciate,
but personally she avoided me like the
plague.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course Stevie has lots of faults, and since
Margaret Louise and I always talked everything
over we used to talk about Stevie in the same
way. I remember that she used to try to draw
me out about Stevie&#8217;s character. I&#8217;ve always
thought Stevie was a kind of piker, that is that
she would say she was going to do a thing, and
then from sheer laziness not do it. My dictionary
was a case in point. She gummed it all up with
her nasty fudge and then wouldn&#8217;t give it back
to me or get me another, but the reason she
wouldn&#8217;t give it back to me was because her feelings
were too fine to return a damaged article,
and not fine enough to make her hump herself and
get me another. That&#8217;s only one kind of a piker
and not the worst kind, but it was <i>pikerish</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this I told quite frankly to Maggie&mdash;I
mean Margaret Louise, because I had no secrets
from her and never thought there was any reason
why I shouldn&#8217;t. Stevie has a horrid brother,
also, who has been up here to dances. All the
girls hate him because he is so spoony. He isn&#8217;t
as spoony as Margaret Louise&#8217;s brother, but he&#8217;s
quite a sloppy little spooner at that. Well, I told
Margaret Louise that I didn&#8217;t like Stevie&#8217;s brother,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
and then I made the damaging remark that one
reason I didn&#8217;t like him was because he looked so
much like Stevie. I didn&#8217;t bother to explain to
Maggie&mdash;I will not call her Maggie Lou any more,
because that is a dear little name and sounds so
affectionate,&mdash;Margaret Louise&mdash;what I meant by
this, because I thought it was perfectly evident.
Stevie is a peachy looking girl, a snow white
blonde with pinky cheeks and dimples. Well, her
brother is a snow white blond too, and he has
pinky cheeks and dimples and his name is Carlo!
We, of course, at once named him Curlo. It is
not a good idea for a man to look too much like his
sister, or to have too many dimples in his chin
and cheeks. I had only to think of him in the
same room with my three uncles to get his number
exactly. I don&#8217;t mean to use slang in my
diary, but I can&#8217;t seem to help it. Professor
Mathews says that slang has a distinct function
in the language&mdash;in replenishing it, but Uncle
Peter says about slang words, that &#8216;many are
called, and few are chosen,&#8217; and there is no need
to try to accommodate them all in one&#8217;s vocabulary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I told Margaret Louise all these things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
about Curlo, and how he tried to hold my hand
coming from the station one day, when the girls
all went up to meet the boys that came up for
the dance,&mdash;and I told her everything else in the
world that happened to come into my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then one day I got thinking about leaving
Harmon&mdash;this is our senior year, of course&mdash;and
I thought that I should leave all the girls
with things just about right between us, excepting
good old Stevie, who had this queer sort of
grouch against me. So I decided that I&#8217;d just go
around and have it out with her, and I did. I
went into her room one day when her roommate
was out, and demanded a show down. Well, I
found out that Maggie&mdash;Margaret Louise had just
repeated to Stevie every living thing that I ever
said about her, just as I said it, only without the
explanations and foot-notes that make any kind of
conversation more understandable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stevie told me all these things one after another,
without stopping, and when she was
through I wished that the floor would open and
swallow me up, but nothing so comfortable happened.
I was obliged to gaze into Stevie&#8217;s overflowing
eyes and own up to the truth as well as I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
could, and explain it. It was the most humiliating
hour that I ever spent, but I told Stevie exactly
what I felt about her &#8216;nothing extenuate, and
naught set down in malice,&#8217; and what I had said
about her to our mutual friend, who by the way,
is not the mutual friend of either of us any
longer. We were both crying by the time I had
finished, but we understood each other. There
were one or two things that she said she didn&#8217;t
think she would ever forget that I had said about
her, but even those she could forgive. She said
that my dislike of her had rankled in her heart
so long that it took away all the bitterness to
know that I wasn&#8217;t really her enemy. She said
that my coming to her that way, and not lying
had showed that I had lots of character, and she
thought in time that we could be quite intimate
friends if I wanted to as much as she did.</p>
<p>&#8220;After my talk with Stevie I still hoped against
hope that Margaret Louise would turn out to
have some reason or excuse for what she had
done. I knew she had done it, but when a thing
like that happens that upsets your whole trust in
a person you simply can not believe the evidence
of your own senses. When you read of a situation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
like that in a book you are all prepared for
it by the author, who has taken the trouble to explain
the moral weakness or unpleasantness of the
character, and given you to understand that you
are to expect a betrayal from him or her; but
when it happens in real life out of a clear sky you
have nothing to go upon that makes you even
<i>believe</i> what you know.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t even try to describe the scene that occurred
between Margaret Louise and me. She cried
and she lied, and she accused me of trying to
curry favor with Stevie, and Stevie of being a
backbiter, and she argued and argued about all
kinds of things but the truth, and when I tried
to pin her down to it, she ducked and crawled
and sidestepped in a way that was dreadful. I&#8217;ve
seen her do something like it before about different
things, and I ought to have known then what
she was like inside of her soul, but I guess you
have to be the object of such a scene before you
realize the full force of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I said was, &#8216;Margaret Louise, if that&#8217;s all
you&#8217;ve got to say about the injury you have done
me, then everything is over between us from this
minute;&#8217; and it was, too.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I had been writing a beautiful
story or poem on what I thought was an enduring
tablet of marble, and some one had come and
wiped it all off as if it were mere scribblings on
a slate. I don&#8217;t know whether it would seem
like telling tales to tell Uncle Peter or not; I
don&#8217;t quite know whether I want to tell him.
Sometimes I wish I had a mother to tell such
things to. It seems to me that a real mother
would know what to say that would help you.
Disillusion is a very strange thing&mdash;like death,
only having people die seems more natural somehow.
When they die you can remember the
happy hours that you spent with them, but when
disillusionment comes then you have lost even
your beautiful memories.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had for the subject of our theme this
week, &#8216;What Life Means to Me,&#8217; which of course
was the object of many facetious remarks from
the girls, but I&#8217;ve been thinking that if I sat
down seriously to state in just so many words
what life means to <i>me</i>, I hardly know what I
would transcribe. It means disillusionment and
death for one thing. Since my grandfather died
last year I have had nobody left of my own in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the world,&mdash;no real blood relation. Of course, I
am a good deal fonder of my aunts and uncles
than most people are of their own flesh and blood,
but own flesh and blood is a thing that it makes
you feel shivery to be without. If I had been
Margaret Louise&#8217;s own flesh and blood, she would
never have acted like that to me. Stevie stuck
up for Carlo as if he was really something to be
proud of. Perhaps my uncles and aunts feel that
way about me, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t even know
if I feel that way about them. I certainly criticize
them in my soul at times, and feel tired of
being dragged around from pillar to post. I
don&#8217;t feel that way about Uncle Peter, but there
is nobody else that I am certain, positive sure
that I love better than life itself. If there is
only one in the world that you feel that way
about, I might not be Uncle Peter&#8217;s one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I wish Margaret Louise had not sold her
birthright for a mess of pottage. I wish I had a
home that I had a perfect right to go and live in
forevermore. I wish my mother was here to
comfort me to-night.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>A Real Kiss</span></h3>
</div>
<p>At seventeen, Eleanor was through at Harmon.
She was to have one year of preparatory
school and then it was the desire of
Beulah&#8217;s heart that she should go to Rogers. The
others contended that the higher education should
be optional and not obligatory. The decision was
finally to be left to Eleanor herself, after she had
considered it in all its bearings.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she doesn&#8217;t decide in favor of college,&#8221; David
said, &#8220;and she makes her home with me here,
as I hope she will do, of course, I don&#8217;t see what
society we are going to be able to give her. Unfortunately
none of our contemporaries have
growing daughters. She ought to meet eligible
young men and that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Margaret cried. The two were having
a cozy cup of tea at his apartment. &#8220;You&#8217;re
so terribly worldly, David, that you frighten me
sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know where I will end, is that the
idea?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where Eleanor will end, if you&#8217;re
already thinking of eligible young men for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those things have got to be thought of,&#8221;
David answered gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose they have,&#8221; Margaret sighed. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want her to be married. I want to take
her off by myself and growl over her all alone
for a while. Then I want Prince Charming to
come along and snatch her up quickly, and set
her behind his milk white charger and ride away
with her. If we&#8217;ve all got to get together and
connive at marrying her off there won&#8217;t be any
comfort in having her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; David said thoughtfully; &#8220;I
think that might be fun, too. A vicarious love-affair
that you can manipulate is one of the most
interesting games in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not my idea of an interesting game,&#8221;
Margaret said. &#8220;I like things very personal,
David,&mdash;you ought to know that by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do know that,&#8221; David said, &#8220;but it sometimes
occurs to me that except for a few obvious
facts of that nature I really know very little about
you, Margaret.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much to know&mdash;except that I&#8217;m a
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good deal,&#8221; David answered slowly;
&#8220;to a mere man that seems to be considerable of
an adventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is about as much of an adventure sometimes
as it would be to be a field of clover in an
insectless world.&mdash;This is wonderful tea, David,
but your cream is like butter and floats around in
it in wudges. No, don&#8217;t get any more, I&#8217;ve got
to go home. Grandmother still thinks it&#8217;s very
improper for me to call upon you, in spite of
Mademoiselle and your ancient and honorable
housekeeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; David said; &#8220;I apologize on my
knees for the cream. I&#8217;ll send out and have it
wet down, or whatever you do to cream in that
state. I want to talk to you. What did you mean
by your last remark?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About the cream, or the proprieties?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything and nothing, David dear. I&#8217;m a
little bit tired of being one, that&#8217;s all, and I want
to go home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She wants to go home when she&#8217;s being so
truly delightful and cryptic,&#8221; David said. &#8220;Have
you been seeing visions, Margaret, in my hearth
fire? Your eyes look as if you had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I did for a minute.&#8221; She rose and
stood absently fitting her gloves to her fingers. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know exactly what it was I saw, but it was
something that made me uncomfortable. It gives
me the creeps to talk about being a woman.
David, do you know sometimes I have a kind of
queer hunch about Eleanor? I love her, you know,
dearly, dearly. I think that she is a very successful
kind of Frankenstein; but there are moments
when I have the feeling that she&#8217;s going to be a
storm center and bring some queer trouble upon
us. I wouldn&#8217;t say this to anybody but you,
David.&#8221;</p>
<p>As David tucked her in the car&mdash;he had arrived
at the dignity of owning one now&mdash;and watched
her sweet silhouette disappear, he, too, had his
moment of clairvoyance. He felt that he was
letting something very precious slip out of sight,
as if some radiant and delicate gift had been laid
lightly within his grasp and as lightly withdrawn
again. As if when the door closed on his friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
Margaret some stranger, more silent creature who
was dear to him had gone with her. As soon as
he was dressed for dinner he called Margaret on
the telephone to know if she had arrived home
safely, and was informed not only that she had,
but that she was very wroth at him for getting
her down three flights of stairs in the midst of
her own dinner toilet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a kind of hunch, too,&#8221; he told her, &#8220;and
I felt as if I wanted to hear your voice speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she only scoffed at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the way you feel about your chauffeur,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;you ought to discharge him, but
he brought me home beautifully.&#8221;</p>
<p>The difference between a man&#8217;s moments of
prescience and a woman&#8217;s, is that the man puts
them out of his consciousness as quickly as he
can, while a woman clings to them fearfully and
goes her way a little more carefully for the momentary
flash of foresight. David tried to see
Margaret once or twice during that week but failed
to find her in when he called or telephoned, and
the special impulse to seek her alone again died
naturally.</p>
<p>One Saturday a few weeks later Eleanor telegraphed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
him that she wished to come to New York
for the week-end to do some shopping.</p>
<p>He went to the train to meet her, and when
the slender chic figure in the most correct of tailor
made suits appeared at the gateway, with an obsequious
porter bearing her smart bag and ulster, he
gave a sudden gasp of surprise at the picture. He
had been aware for some time of the increase in
her inches and the charm of the pure cameo-cut
profile, but he regarded her still as a child histrionically
assuming the airs and graces of womanhood,
as small girl children masquerade in the
trailing skirts of their elders. He was accustomed
to the idea that she was growing up rapidly, but
the fact that she was already grown had never
actually dawned on him until this moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as if you were surprised to see me,
Uncle David,&mdash;are you?&#8221; she said, slipping a slim
hand, warm through its immaculate glove, into
his. &#8220;You knew I was coming, and you came to
meet me, and yet you looked as surprised as if you
hadn&#8217;t expected me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surprised to see you just about expresses it,
Eleanor. I am surprised to see you. I was looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
for a little girl in hair ribbons with her skirts
to her knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a blue tam-o&#8217;-shanter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a blue tam-o&#8217;-shanter. I had forgotten
you had grown up any to speak of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see me every vacation,&#8221; Eleanor grumbled,
as she stepped into the waiting motor. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
because you lack opportunity that you don&#8217;t notice
what I look like. It&#8217;s just because you&#8217;re naturally
unobserving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter and Jimmie have been making a good
deal of fuss about your being a young lady, now
I think of it. Peter especially has been rather a
nuisance about it, breaking into my most precious
moments of triviality with the sweetly solemn
thought that our little girl has grown to be a
woman now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, does <i>he</i> think I&#8217;m grown up, does he
really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie is almost as bad. He&#8217;s all the time
wanting me to get you to New York over the weekend,
so that he can see if you are any taller than
you were the last time he saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they coming to see me this evening?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie is going to look in. Peter is tied up
with his sister. You know she&#8217;s on here from
China with her daughter. Peter wants you to meet
the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be as grown up as I am,&#8221; Eleanor
said. &#8220;I used to have her room, you know, when
I stayed with Uncle Peter. Does Uncle Peter like
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as much as he likes you, Miss Green-eyes.
He says she looks like a heathen Chinee but otherwise
is passable. I didn&#8217;t know that you added
jealousy to the list of your estimable vices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not jealous,&#8221; Eleanor protested; &#8220;or if I
am it&#8217;s only because she&#8217;s blood relation,&mdash;and I&#8217;m
not, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good deal more prosaic to be a blood
relation, if anybody should ask you,&#8221; David smiled.
&#8220;A blood relation is a good deal like the famous
primrose on the river&#8217;s brim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A primrose by the river&#8217;s brim a yellow primrose
was to him,&mdash;and nothing more,&#8217;&#8221; Eleanor
quoted gaily. &#8220;Why, what more&mdash;&#8221; she broke off
suddenly and colored slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What more would anybody want to be than a
yellow primrose by the river&#8217;s brim?&#8221; David finished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
for her. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure. I&#8217;m a
mere man and such questions are too abstruse for
me, as I told your Aunt Margaret the other day.
Now I think of it, though, you don&#8217;t look unlike
a yellow primrose yourself to-day, daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve got a yellow ribbon on my
hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the resemblance goes much deeper. It has
something to do with youth and fragrance and the
flowers that bloom in the spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The flowers that bloom in the spring, tra la,&#8221;
Eleanor returned saucily, &#8220;have nothing to do with
the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s learning that she has eyes, good Lord,&#8221;
David said to himself, but aloud he remarked
paternally, &#8220;I saw all your aunts yesterday. Gertrude
gave a tea party and invited a great many
famous tea party types, and ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Aunt Beulah there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said all your aunts. Beulah was there, like
the famous Queenie, with her hair in a braid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty nearly. She&#8217;s gone in for dress reform
now, you know, a kind of middy blouse made out
of a striped porti&egrave;re with a kilted skirt of the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
material and a Scotch cap. She doesn&#8217;t look so
bad in it. Your Aunt Beulah presents a peculiar
phenomenon these days. She&#8217;s growing better-looking
and behaving worse every day of her life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Behaving worse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s theory ridden and fad bitten. She&#8217;ll
come to a bad end if something doesn&#8217;t stop her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;stop her working for suffrage?
I&#8217;m a suffragist, Uncle David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And quite right to remind me of it before I
began slamming the cause. No, I don&#8217;t mean
suffrage. I believe in suffrage myself. I mean the
way she&#8217;s going after it. There are healthy ways
of insisting on your rights and unhealthy ways.
Beulah&#8217;s getting further and further off key, that&#8217;s
all. Here we are at home, daughter. Your poor
old cooperative father welcomes you to the associated
hearthstone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This front entrance looks more like my front
entrance than any other place does,&#8221; Eleanor said.
&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m so glad to be here. George, how is the
baby?&#8221; she asked the black elevator man, who
beamed delightedly upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! I didn&#8217;t know he had one,&#8221; David
chuckled. &#8220;It takes a woman&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>Jimmie appeared in the evening, laden with violets
and a five pound box of the chocolates most
in favor in the politest circles at the moment.
David whistled when he saw them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s devouring you, papa?&#8221; Jimmie asked
him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I always place tributes at the feet of
the offspring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mirror candy and street corner violets, yes,&#8221;
David said. &#8220;It&#8217;s only the labels that surprised
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows the difference, now,&#8221; Jimmie answered,
&#8220;what would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The night before her return to school it was
decreed that she should go to bed early. She had
spent two busy days of shopping and &#8220;seeing the
family.&#8221; She had her hours discussing her future
with Peter, long visits and talks with Margaret
and Gertrude, and a cup of tea at suffrage headquarters
with Beulah, as well as long sessions in
the shops accompanied by Mademoiselle, who made
her home now permanently with David. She sat
before the fire drowsily constructing pyramids out
of the embers and David stood with one arm on
the mantel, smoking his after-dinner cigar, and
watching her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it to be college, Eleanor?&#8221; he asked her
presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to make up my mind, Uncle
David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like the idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d love it,&mdash;if&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If what, daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I thought I could spare the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The time? Elucidate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to earn my own living, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. I&#8217;ve got to&mdash;in order to&mdash;to feel right
about things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like the style of living to which your
cooperative parents have accustomed you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I love everything you&#8217;ve ever done for me,
but I can&#8217;t go on letting you do things for me
forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why not exactly. It doesn&#8217;t
seem&mdash;right, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your New England conscience, Eleanor;
one of the most specious varieties of consciences
in the world. It will always be tempting you to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
do good that better may come. Don&#8217;t listen to it,
daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in earnest, Uncle David. I don&#8217;t know
whether I would be better fitted to earn my living
if I went to business college or real college. What
do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think,&mdash;I&#8217;m stupefied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter couldn&#8217;t think, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you mentioned this brilliant idea to
Peter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He talked it over with me, but I think he thinks
I&#8217;ll change my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll change your mind. Good heavens!
Eleanor, we&#8217;re all able to afford you&mdash;the
little we spend on you is nothing divided among
six of us. It&#8217;s our pleasure and privilege. When
did you come to this extraordinary decision?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A long time ago. The day that Mrs. Bolling
talked to me, I think. There are things she said
that I&#8217;ve never forgotten. I told Uncle Peter to
think about it and then help me to decide which to
do, and I want you to think, Uncle David, and tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
me truly what you believe the best preparation for
a business life would be. I thought perhaps I
might be a stenographer in an editorial office, and
my training there would be more use to me than
four years at college, but I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an extraordinary young woman,&#8221; David
said, staring at her. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you broached this
subject, if only that I might realize how extraordinary,
but I don&#8217;t think anything will come of it,
my dear. I don&#8217;t want you to go to college unless
you really want to, but if you do want to, I hope
you will take up the pursuit of learning as a pursuit
and not as a means to an end. Do you hear
me, daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s have no more of this nonsense of
earning your own living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you really displeased, Uncle David?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be if I thought you were serious,&mdash;but
it&#8217;s bedtime. If you&#8217;re going to get your beauty
sleep, my dear, you ought to begin on it immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor rose obediently, her brow clouded a
little, and her head held high. David watched the
color coming and going in the sweet face and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
tender breast rising and falling with her quickening
breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps you would understand,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had always kissed him &#8220;good night&#8221; until
this visit, and he had refrained from commenting
on the omission before, but now he put out his
hand to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you forgotten something?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;There is only one way for a daughter to say
good night to her parent.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put up her face, and as she did so he caught
the glint of tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Eleanor, dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did you care?&#8221;
And he kissed her. Then his lips sought hers again.</p>
<p>With his arms still about her shoulder he stood
looking down at her. A hot tide of crimson made
its way slowly to her brow and then receded,
accentuating the clear pallor of her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a real kiss, dear,&#8221; he said slowly.
&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t get such things confused. I won&#8217;t
bother you with talking about it to-night, or until
you are ready. Until then we&#8217;ll pretend that it
didn&#8217;t happen, but if the thought of it should ever
disturb you the least bit, dear, you are to remember
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
that the time is coming when I shall have something
to say about it; will you remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle David,&#8221; Eleanor said uncertainly,
&#8220;but I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>David took her unceremoniously by the shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go now,&#8221; he said, and she obeyed him without
further question.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Beulah&#8217;s Problem</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Peter was shaving for the evening. His
sister was giving a dinner party for two of
her husband&#8217;s fellow bankers and their wives.
After that they were going to see the latest Belasco
production, and from there to some one of the new
dancing &#8220;clubs,&#8221;&mdash;the smart cabarets that were
forced to organize in the guise of private enterprises
to evade the two o&#8217;clock closing law. Peter
enjoyed dancing, but he did not as a usual thing
enjoy bankers&#8217; wives. He was deliberating on the
possibility of excusing himself gracefully after the
theater, on the plea of having some work to do, and
finally decided that his sister&#8217;s feelings would be
hurt if she realized he was trying to escape the
climax of the hospitality she had provided so
carefully.</p>
<p>He gazed at himself intently over the drifts of
lather and twisted his shaving mirror to the most
propitious angle from time to time. In the room
across the hall&mdash;Eleanor&#8217;s room, he always called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
it to himself&mdash;his young niece was singing bits of
the Mascagni intermezzo interspersed with bits of
the latest musical comedy, in a rather uncertain
contralto.</p>
<p>&#8220;My last girl came from Vassar, and I don&#8217;t
know where to class her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter&#8217;s mind took up the refrain automatically.
&#8220;My last girl&mdash;&#8221; and began at the beginning of the
chorus again. &#8220;My last girl came from Vassar,&#8221;
which brought him by natural stages to the consideration
of the higher education and of Beulah, and
a conversation concerning her that he had had
with Jimmie and David the night before.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s off her nut,&#8221; Jimmie said succinctly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not exactly that there&#8217;s nobody home,&#8221; he rapped
his curly pate significantly, &#8220;but there&#8217;s too much
of a crowd there. She&#8217;s not the same old girl at
all. She used to be a good fellow, high-brow
propaganda and all. Now she&#8217;s got nothing else
in her head. What&#8217;s happened to her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what hasn&#8217;t happened to her that&#8217;s addled
her,&#8221; David explained. &#8220;It&#8217;s these highly charged,
hypersensitive young women that go to pieces
under the modern pressure. They&#8217;re the ones that
need licking into shape by all the natural processes.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;By which you mean a drunken husband and a
howling family?&#8221; Jimmie suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, or its polite equivalent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is true, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;Feminism
isn&#8217;t the answer to Beulah&#8217;s problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the problem,&#8221; David said; &#8220;she&#8217;s poisoning
herself with it. I know what I&#8217;m talking about.
I&#8217;ve seen it happen. My cousin Jack married a girl
with a sister a great deal like Beulah, looks, temperament,
and everything else, though she wasn&#8217;t
half so nice. She got going the militant pace and
couldn&#8217;t stop herself. I never met her at a dinner
party that she wasn&#8217;t tackling somebody on the
subject of man&#8217;s inhumanity to woman. She ended
in a sanitorium; in fact, they&#8217;re thinking now of
taking her to the&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;bug house,&#8221; Jimmie finished cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;And in the beginning she was a perfectly good
girl that needed nothing in the world but a chance
to develop along legitimate lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The frustrate matron, eh?&#8221; Peter said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The frustrate matron,&#8221; David agreed gravely.
&#8220;I wonder you haven&#8217;t realized this yourself, Gram.
You&#8217;re keener about such things than I am. Beulah
is more your job than mine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one she listens to or looks up
to. Go up and tackle her some day and see what
you can do. She&#8217;s sinking fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her the once over and throw out the lifeline,&#8221;
Jimmie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought all this stuff was a phase, a part of
her taking herself seriously as she always has. I
had no idea it was anything to worry about,&#8221; Peter
persisted. &#8220;Are you sure she&#8217;s in bad shape&mdash;that
she&#8217;s got anything more than a bad attack of Feminism
of the Species in its most virulent form?
They come out of <i>that</i>, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s batty,&#8221; Jimmie nodded gravely. &#8220;Dave&#8217;s
got the right dope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go up and look her over,&#8221; David persisted;
&#8220;you&#8217;ll see what we mean, then. Beulah&#8217;s in a
bad way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter reviewed this conversation while he shaved
the right side of his face, and frowned prodigiously
through the lather. He wished that he had
an engagement that evening that he could break
in order to get to see Beulah at once, and discover
for himself the harm that had come to his friend.
He was devoted to Beulah. He had always felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
that he saw a little more clearly than the others
the virtue that was in the girl. He admired the
pluck with which she made her attack on life and
the energy with which she accomplished her ends.
There was to him something alluring and quaint
about her earnestness. The fact that her soundness
could be questioned came to him with something
like a shock. As soon as he was dressed he was
called to the telephone to talk to David.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret has just told me that Doctor Penrose
has been up to see Beulah and pronounces it a
case of nervous breakdown. He wants her to try
out psycho-analysis, and that sort of thing. He
seems to feel that it&#8217;s serious. Margaret is fearfully
upset, poor girl. So&#8217;m I, to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so am I,&#8221; Peter acknowledged to himself
as he hung up the receiver. He was so absorbed
during the evening that one of the ladies&mdash;the wife
of the fat banker&mdash;found him extremely dull and
decided against asking him to dinner with his sister.
The wife of the thin banker, who was in his
charge at the theater, got the benefit of his effort
to rouse himself and grace the occasion creditably,
and found him delightful. By the time the evening
was over he had decided that Beulah should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
pulled out of whatever dim world of dismay and
delusion she might be wandering in, at whatever
cost. It was unthinkable that she should be wasted,
or that her youth and splendid vitality should go
for naught.</p>
<p>He found her eager to talk to him the next
night when he went to see her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I want you to go to my aunt
and my mother, and tell them that I&#8217;ve got to go
on with my work,&mdash;that I can&#8217;t be stopped and
interrupted by this foolishness of doctors and
nurses. I never felt better in my life, except for
not being able to sleep, and I think that is due to
the way they have worried me. I live in a world
they don&#8217;t know anything about, that&#8217;s all. Even
if they were right, if I am wearing myself out soul
and body for the sake of the cause, what business
is it of theirs to interfere? I&#8217;m working for the
souls and bodies of women for ages to come.
What difference does it make if my soul and body
suffer? Why shouldn&#8217;t they?&#8221; Her eyes narrowed.
Peter observed the unnatural light in
them, the apparent dryness of her lips, the two
bright spots burning below her cheek-bones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he answered her slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
think it was the original intention of Him who put
us here that we should sacrifice everything we are to
the business of emphasizing the superiority of a sex.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the point at all, Peter. No man
understands, no man can understand. It&#8217;s woman&#8217;s
equality we want emphasized, just literally that
and nothing more. You&#8217;ve pauperized and degraded
us long enough&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou canst not say I&mdash;&#8221; Peter began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you and every other man, every man in
the world is a party to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to get her going,&#8221; Peter apologized to
himself, &#8220;in order to get a point of departure.
Not if I vote for women, Beulah, dear,&#8221; he
added aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you throw your influence with us instead of
against us,&#8221; she conceded, &#8220;you&#8217;re helping to right
the wrong that you have permitted for so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, granting your premise, granting all your
premises, Beulah&mdash;and I admit that most of them
have sound reasoning behind them&mdash;your battle
now is all over but the shouting. There&#8217;s no reason
that you personally should sacrifice your last drop
of energy to a campaign that&#8217;s practically won
already.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you think the mere franchise is all I have
been working for, Peter,&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I know the thousand and one activities
you women are concerned with. I know how
much better church and state always have been
and are bound to be, when the women get behind
and push, if they throw their strength right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah rose enthusiastically to this bait and
talked rationally and well for some time. Just as
Peter was beginning to feel that David and Jimmie
had been guilty of the most unsympathetic
exaggeration of her state of mind&mdash;unquestionably
she was not as fit physically as usual&mdash;she
startled him with an abrupt change into almost
hysterical incoherence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a right to live my own life,&#8221; she concluded,
&#8220;and nobody&mdash;nobody shall stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all living our own lives, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;
Peter asked mildly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No woman lives her own life to-day,&#8221; Beulah
cried, still excitedly. &#8220;Every woman is living the
life of some man, who has the legal right to treat
her as an imbecile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Beulah. How about the suffrage
states, how about the women who are already in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
the proud possession of their rights and privileges?
They are not technical imbeciles any longer according
to your theory. The vote&#8217;s coming. Every
woman will be a super-woman in two shakes,&mdash;so
what&#8217;s devouring you, as Jimmie says?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s after all the states have suffrage that the
big fight will really begin,&#8221; Beulah answered
wearily. &#8220;It&#8217;s the habit of wearing the yoke we&#8217;ll
have to fight then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The anti-feminists,&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;I see. Beulah,
can&#8217;t you give yourself any rest, or is the
nature of the cause actually suicidal?&#8221;</p>
<p>To his surprise her tense face quivered at this
and she tried to steady a tremulous lower lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am tired,&#8221; she said, a little piteously, &#8220;dreadfully
tired, but nobody cares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friends care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They only want to stop me doing something
they have no sympathy with. What do Gertrude
and Margaret know of the real purpose of my life
or my failure or success? They take a sentimental
interest in my health, that&#8217;s all. Do you suppose
it made any difference to Jeanne d&#8217;Arc how many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
people took a sympathetic interest in her health if
they didn&#8217;t believe in what she believed in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Eleanor would grow up to take an
interest in the position of women, and to care about
the things I cared about, but she&#8217;s not going to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very fond of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as fond as she is of Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter longed to dispute this, but he could not in
honesty.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a suffragist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s so lukewarm she might just as well be
an anti. She&#8217;s naturally reactionary. Women
like that aren&#8217;t much use. They drag us back like
so much dead weight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Eleanor has been a disappointment
to you,&#8221; Peter mused, &#8220;but she tries pretty hard
to be all things to all parents, Beulah. You&#8217;ll find
she won&#8217;t fail you if you need her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t need her,&#8221; Beulah said, prophetically.
&#8220;I hoped she&#8217;d stand beside me in the work, but
she&#8217;s not that kind. She&#8217;ll marry early and have
a family, and that will be the end of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if she will,&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;I hope so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
She still seems such a child to me. I believe in
marriage, Beulah, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her answer surprised him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under certain conditions, I do. I made a vow
once that I would never marry and I&#8217;ve always
believed that it would be hampering and limiting
to a woman, but now I see that the fight has got
to go on. If there are going to be women to carry
on the fight they will have to be born of the women
who are fighting to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; Peter said devoutly. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t
make any difference why you believe it, if you do
believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes all the difference,&#8221; Beulah said, but
her voice softened. &#8220;What I believe is more to
me than anything else in the world, Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, too. I understand your point
of view, Beulah. You carry it a little bit too far,
that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s wrong with it from my way of
thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you help me to go on, Peter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk to my aunt and my mother. Tell them
that they&#8217;re all wrong in their treatment of me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think I could undertake to do that&#8221;&mdash;Peter
was convinced that a less antagonistic attitude on
the part of her relatives would be more successful&mdash;&#8220;and
I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah&#8217;s eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one who comes anywhere near
knowing,&#8221; she said, &#8220;or who ever will, I guess. I
try so hard, Peter, and now when I don&#8217;t seem to
be accomplishing as much as I want to, as much
as it&#8217;s necessary for me to accomplish if I am to
go on respecting myself, every one enters into a
conspiracy to stop my doing anything at all. The
only thing that makes me nervous is the way I am
thwarted and opposed at every turn. I haven&#8217;t got
nervous prostration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not, but you have something remarkably
like <i>ide&ecirc; fixe</i>,&#8221; Peter said to himself compassionately.</p>
<p>He found her actual condition less dangerous
but much more difficult than he had anticipated.
She was living wrong, that was the sum and substance
of her malady. Her life was spent confronting
theories and discounting conditions. She
did not realize that it is only the interest of our
investment in life that we can sanely contribute to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
the cause of living. Our capital strength and
energy must be used for the struggle for existence
itself if we are to have a world of balanced individuals.
There is an arrogance involved in
assuming ourselves more humane than human that
reacts insidiously on our health and morals. Peter,
looking into the twitching hectic face before him
with the telltale glint of mania in the eyes, felt
himself becoming helpless with pity for a mind
gone so far askew. He felt curiously responsible
for Beulah&#8217;s condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t have run herself so far aground,&#8221;
he thought, &#8220;if I had been on the job a little more.
I could have helped her to steer straighter. A word
here and a lift there and she would have come
through all right. Now something&#8217;s got to stop
her or she can&#8217;t be stopped. She&#8217;ll preach once
too often out of the tail of a cart on the subject
of equal guardianship,&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah put her hands to her face suddenly, and,
sinking back into the depths of the big cushioned
chair on the edge of which she had been tensely
poised during most of the conversation, burst into
tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one that knows,&#8221; she sobbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
over and over again. &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired, Peter, but
I&#8217;ve got to go on and on and on. If they stop me,
I&#8217;ll kill myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peter crossed the room to her side and sat down
on her chair-arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, dear,&#8221; he said, with a hand on her
head. &#8220;You&#8217;re too tired to think things out now,&mdash;but
I&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted a piteous face, for the moment so
startlingly like that of the dead girl he had loved
that his senses were confused by the resemblance.</p>
<p>&#8220;How, Peter?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;How can you help
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I see the way,&#8221; he said slowly.</p>
<p>He slipped to his knees and gathered her close
in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this will be the way, dear,&#8221; he said very
gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does this mean that you want me to marry
you?&#8221; she whispered, when she was calmer.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will, dear,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&mdash;if I can, if I can make it seem right
to after I&#8217;ve thought it all out.&mdash;Oh! Peter, I love
you. I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no idea of that,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
it&#8217;s wonderful that you do. I&#8217;ll put everything
I&#8217;ve got into trying to make you happy, Beulah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you will, Peter.&#8221; Her arms closed
around his neck and tightened there. &#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made her comfortable and she relaxed like a
tired child, almost asleep under his soothing hand,
and the quiet spell of his tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it could be like this,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it can,&#8221; he answered her.</p>
<p>In his heart he was saying, &#8220;This is best. I am
sure this is best. It is the right and normal way
for her&mdash;and for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her tri-cornered dormitory room at the new
school which she was not sharing with any one this
year Eleanor, enveloped in a big brown and yellow
wadded bathrobe, was writing a letter to Peter.
Her hair hung in two golden brown braids over
her shoulders and her pure profile was bent intently
over the paper. At the moment when Beulah
made her confession of love and closed her eyes
against the breast of the man who had just asked
her to marry him, two big tears forced their way
between Eleanor&#8217;s lids and splashed down upon her
letter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Mostly Uncle Peter</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dear Uncle Peter,&#8221; the letter ran,
&#8220;I am very, very homesick and lonely for
you to-day. It seems to me that I would gladly give
a whole year of my life just for the privilege of
being with you, and talking instead of writing,&mdash;but
since that can not be, I am going to try and
write you about the thing that is troubling me. I
can&#8217;t bear it alone any longer, and still I don&#8217;t know
whether it is the kind of thing that it is honorable
to tell or not. So you see I am very much troubled
and puzzled, and this trouble involves some one
else in a way that it is terrible to think of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter, dear, I do not want to be married.
Not until I have grown up, and seen something
of the world. You know it is one of my
dearest wishes to be self-supporting, not because I
am a Feminist or a new woman, or have &#8216;the unnatural
belief of an antipathy to man&#8217; that you&#8217;re
always talking about, but just because it will prove
to me once and for all that I belong to myself, and
that my <i>soul</i> isn&#8217;t, and never has been cooperative.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
You know what I mean by this, and you are not
hurt by my feeling so. You, I am sure, would not
want me to be married, or to have to think of myself
as engaged, especially not to anybody that we
all knew and loved, and who is very close to me
and you in quite another way. Please don&#8217;t try to
imagine what I mean, Uncle Peter&mdash;even if you
know, you must tell yourself that you don&#8217;t know.
Please, please pretend even to yourself that I
haven&#8217;t written you this letter. I know people do
tell things like this, but I don&#8217;t know quite how
they bring themselves to do it, even if they have
somebody like you who understands everything&mdash;everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter, dear, I am supposed to be going
to be married by and by when the one who wants
it feels that it can be spoken of, and until that
happens, I&#8217;ve got to wait for him to speak, unless I
can find some way to tell him that I do not want it
ever to be. I don&#8217;t know how to tell him. I don&#8217;t
know how to make him feel that I do not belong
to him. It is only myself I belong to, and I belong
to you, but I don&#8217;t know how to make that plain
to any one who does not know it already. I can&#8217;t
say it unless perhaps you can help me to.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am different from the other girls. I know
every girl always thinks there is something different
about her, but I think there are ways in which
I truly am different. When I want anything I
know more clearly what it is, and why I want it
than most other girls do, and not only that, but I
know now, that I want to keep myself, and everything
I think and feel and am,&mdash;<i>sacred</i>. There is
an inner shrine in a woman&#8217;s soul that she must
keep inviolate. I know that now.</p>
<p>&#8220;A liberty that you haven&#8217;t known how, or had
the strength to prevent, is a terrible thing. One
can&#8217;t forget it. Uncle Peter, dear, twice in my life
things have happened that drive me almost desperate
when I think of them. If these things should
happen again when I know that I don&#8217;t want them
to, I don&#8217;t think there would be any way of my
bearing it. Perhaps you can tell me something
that will make me find a way out of this tangle.
I don&#8217;t see what it could be, but lots of times you
have shown me the way out of endless mazes that
were not grown up troubles like this, but seemed
very real to me just the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Peter, dear, dear, dear,&mdash;you are all I
have. I wish you were here to-night, though you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
wouldn&#8217;t be let in, even if you beat on the gate
ever so hard, for it&#8217;s long after bedtime. I am up
in my tower room all alone. Oh! answer this
letter. Answer it quickly, quickly.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Eleanor read her letter over and addressed a
tear splotched envelope to Peter. Then she slowly
tore letter and envelope into little bits.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would know,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t any real right to tell him. It would be just
as bad as any kind of tattling.&#8221;</p>
<p>She began another letter to him but found she
could not write without saying what was in her
heart, and so went to bed uncomforted. There
was nothing in her experience to help her in her
relation to David. His kiss on her lips had taught
her the nature of such kisses: had made her understand
suddenly the ease with which the strange,
sweet spell of sex is cast. She related it to the
episode of the unwelcome caress bestowed upon
her by the brother of Maggie Lou, and that half
forgotten incident took on an almost terrible significance.
She understood now how she should
have repelled that unconscionable boy, but that
understanding did not help her with the problem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
of her Uncle David. Though the thought of it
thrilled through her with a strange incredible
delight, she did not want another kiss of his upon
her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;like that,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;I
want it to be from somebody&mdash;else. Somebody
<i>realer</i> to me. Somebody that would make it seem
right.&#8221; But even to herself she mentioned no
names.</p>
<p>She had definitely decided against going to college.
She felt that she must get upon her own
feet quickly and be under no obligation to any man.
Vaguely her stern New England rearing was beginning
to indicate the way that she should tread.
No man or woman who did not understand &#8220;the
value of a dollar,&#8221; was properly equipped to do
battle with the realities of life. The value of a
dollar, and a clear title to it&mdash;these were the principles
upon which her integrity must be founded
if she were to survive her own self-respect. Her
Puritan fathers had bestowed this heritage upon
her. She had always felt the irregularity of her
economic position; now that the complication of
her relation with David had arisen, it was beginning
to make her truly uncomfortable.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>David had been very considerate of her, but his
consideration frightened her. He had been so
afraid that she might be hurt or troubled by his
attitude toward her that he had explained again,
and almost in so many words that he was only
waiting for her to grow accustomed to the idea
before he asked her to become his wife. She had
looked forward with considerable trepidation to
the Easter vacation following the establishment of
their one-sided understanding, but David relieved
her apprehension by putting up at his club and
leaving her in undisturbed possession of his quarters.
There, with Mademoiselle still treating her
as a little girl, and the other five of her heterogeneous
foster family to pet and divert her at
intervals, she soon began to feel her life swing
back into a more accustomed and normal perspective.
David&#8217;s attitude to her was as simple as
ever, and when she was with the devoted sextet
she was almost able to forget the matter that was
at issue between them&mdash;almost but not quite.</p>
<p>She took quite a new kind of delight in her
association with the group. She found herself suddenly
on terms of grown up equality with them.
Her consciousness of the fact that David was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
tacitly waiting for her to become a woman, had
made a woman of her already, and she looked on
her guardians with the eyes of a woman, even
though a very newly fledged and timorous one.</p>
<p>She was a trifle self-conscious with the others,
but with Jimmie she was soon on her old familiar
footing.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jimmie is still a great deal of fun,&#8221; she
wrote in her diary. &#8220;He does just the same old
things he used to do with me, and a good many
new ones in addition. He brings me flowers, and
gets me taxi-cabs as if I were really a grown up
young lady, and he pinches my nose and teases me
as if I were still the little girl that kept house in
a studio for him. I never realized before what a
good-looking man he is. I used to think that
Uncle Peter was the only handsome man of the
three, but now I realize that they are all exceptionally
good-looking. Uncle David has a great
deal of distinction, of course, but Uncle Jimmie
is merry and radiant and vital, and tall and athletic
looking into the bargain. The ladies on the
Avenue all turn to look at him when we go walking.
He says that the gentlemen all turn to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
at me, and I think perhaps they do when I have
my best clothes on, but in my school clothes I am
quite certain that nothing like that happens.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been out with Uncle Jimmie Tuesday
and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday,&mdash;four
days of my vacation. We&#8217;ve been to the Hippodrome
and Chinatown, and we&#8217;ve dined at Sherry&#8217;s,
and one night we went down to the little Italian
restaurant where I had my first introduction to
<i>eau rougie</i>, and was so distressed about it. I
shall never forget that night, and I don&#8217;t think
Uncle Jimmie will ever be done teasing me about
it. It is nice to be with Uncle Jimmie so much,
but I never seem to see Uncle Peter any more.
Alphonse is very careful about taking messages, I
know, but it does seem to me that Uncle Peter
must have telephoned more times than I know of.
It does seem as if he would, at least, try to see
me long enough to have one of our old time talks
again. To see him with all the others about is
only a very little better than not seeing him at all.
He isn&#8217;t like himself, someway. There is a shadow
over him that I do not understand.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that Uncle Peter has changed?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
she asked Jimmie, when the need of speaking of
him became too strong to withstand.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a little pale about the ears,&#8221; Jimmie conceded,
&#8220;but I think that&#8217;s the result of hard work
and not enough exercise. He spends all his spare
time trying to patch up Beulah instead of tramping
and getting out on his horse the way he used to.
He&#8217;s doing a good job on the old dear, but it&#8217;s
some job, nevertheless and notwithstanding&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Aunt Beulah feeling better than she was?&#8221;
Eleanor&#8217;s lips were dry, but she did her best to
make her voice sound natural. It seemed strange
that Jimmie could speak so casually of a condition
of affairs that made her very heart stand still. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know that Uncle Peter had been taking
care of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking care of her isn&#8217;t a circumstance to
what Peter has been doing for Beulah. You know
she hasn&#8217;t been right for some time. She got
burning wrong, like the flame on our old gas
stove in the studio when there was air in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle David thought so the last time I was
here,&#8221; Eleanor said, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t know that
Uncle Peter&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Peter, curiously enough, was the last one to
tumble. Dave and I got alarmed about the girl
and held a consultation, with the result that Doctor
Gramercy was called. If we&#8217;d believed he would
go into it quite so heavily we might have thought
again before we sicked him on. It&#8217;s very nice
for Mary Ann, but rather tough on Abraham as
they said when the lady was deposited on that
already overcrowded bosom. Now Beulah&#8217;s got
suffrage mania, and Peter&#8217;s got Beulah mania, and
it&#8217;s a merry mess all around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Uncle Peter with her a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every minute. You haven&#8217;t seen much of him
since you came, have you?&mdash;Well, the reason is
that every afternoon as soon as he can get away
from the office, he puts on a broad sash marked
&#8216;Votes for Women,&#8217; and trundles Beulah around
in her little white and green perambulator, trying
to distract her mind from suffrage while he talks
to her gently and persuasively upon the subject.
Suffrage is the only subject on her mind, he explains,
so all he can do is to try to cuckoo gently
under it day by day. It&#8217;s a very complicated process
but he&#8217;s making headway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that,&#8221; Eleanor said faintly. &#8220;How&mdash;how
is Aunt Gertrude? I don&#8217;t see her very
often, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gertrude&#8217;s all right.&#8221; It was Jimmie&#8217;s turn to
look self-conscious. &#8220;She never has time for me
any more; I&#8217;m not high-brow enough for her.
She&#8217;s getting on like a streak, you know, exhibiting
everywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know she is. She gave me a cast of her
faun&#8217;s head. I think it is lovely. Aunt Margaret
looks well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is, I guess, but don&#8217;t let&#8217;s waste all our
valuable time talking about the family. Let&#8217;s talk
about us&mdash;you and me. You ask me how I&#8217;m
feeling and then I&#8217;ll tell you. Then I&#8217;ll ask you
how you&#8217;re feeling and you&#8217;ll tell me. Then
I&#8217;ll tell you how I imagine you must be feeling
from the way you&#8217;re looking,&mdash;and that will give
me a chance to expatiate on the delectability of
your appearance. I&#8217;ll work up delicately to the
point where you will begin to compare me favorably
with all the other nice young men you know,&mdash;and
then we&#8217;ll be off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we?&#8221; Eleanor asked, beginning to sparkle
a little.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We shall indeed,&#8221; he assured her solemnly.
&#8220;You begin. No, on second thoughts, I&#8217;ll begin.
I&#8217;ll begin at the place where I start telling you
how excessively well you&#8217;re looking. I don&#8217;t know,
considering its source, whether it would interest
you or not, but you have the biggest blue eyes that
I&#8217;ve, ever seen in all my life,&mdash;and I&#8217;m rather a
judge of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the better to eat you with, my dear,&#8221;
Eleanor chanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite correct.&#8221; He shot her a queer glance
from under his eyebrows. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel very safe
when I look into them, my child. It would be a
funny joke on me if they did prove fatal to me,
wouldn&#8217;t it?&mdash;well,&mdash;but away with such nonsense.
I mustn&#8217;t blither to the very babe whose cradle I
am rocking, must I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a babe, Uncle Jimmie. I feel very old
sometimes. Older than any of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! you are, you are. You&#8217;re a regular sphinx
sometimes. Peter says that you even disconcert
him at times, when you take to remembering things
out of your previous experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;When he was a King in Babylon and I was a
Christian Slave?&#8217;&#8221; she quoted quickly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. Only I&#8217;d prefer to play the part of the
King of Babylon, if it&#8217;s all the same to you, niecelet.
How does the rest of it go, &#8216;yet not for a&mdash;&#8217; something
or other &#8216;would I wish undone that deed
beyond the grave.&#8217; Gosh, my dear, if things were
otherwise, I think I could understand how that
feller felt. Get on your hat, and let&#8217;s get out into
the open. My soul is cramped with big potentialities
this afternoon. I wish you hadn&#8217;t grown up,
Eleanor. You are taking my breath away in a
peculiar manner. No man likes to have his breath
taken away so suddint like. Let&#8217;s get out into the
rolling prairie of Central Park.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the rest of the afternoon was rather a failure.
The Park had that peculiar bleakness that
foreruns the first promise of spring. The children,
that six weeks before were playing in the snow and
six weeks later would be searching the turf for
dandelions, were in the listless between seasons
state of comparative inactivity. There was a deceptive
balminess in the air that seemed merely to
overlay a penetrating chilliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m not more entertaining this afternoon,&#8221;
Jimmie apologized on the way home. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t that I am not happy, or that I don&#8217;t feel the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
occasion to be more than ordinarily propitious;
I&#8217;m silent upon a peak in Darien,&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of something else, too,&#8221; Eleanor
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I was thinking of something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People are always thinking of something else
when they aren&#8217;t talking to each other, aren&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something else, or each other, Eleanor. I
wasn&#8217;t thinking of something else, I was thinking&mdash;well,
I won&#8217;t tell you exactly&mdash;at present. A
penny for your thoughts, little one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They aren&#8217;t worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A penny is a good deal of money. You can
buy joy for a penny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I couldn&#8217;t&mdash;buy joy, even if you
gave me your penny, Uncle Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might try. My penny might not be like
other pennies. On the other hand, your thoughts
might be worth a fortune to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they wouldn&#8217;t be worth anything to
anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You simply don&#8217;t know what I am capable of
making out of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could make something out of them,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
Eleanor said so miserably that Jimmie was filled
with compunction for having tired her out, and
hailed a passing taxi in which to whiz her home
again.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;I have found out that Uncle Peter is spending
all his time with Aunt Beulah,&#8221; she wrote in her
diary that evening. &#8220;It is beautiful of him to try
to help her through this period of nervous collapse,
and just like him, but I don&#8217;t understand
why it is that he doesn&#8217;t come and tell me about
it, especially since he is getting so tired. He ought
to know that I love him so dearly and deeply that
I could help him even in helping her. It isn&#8217;t like
him not to share his anxieties with me. Aunt
Beulah is a grown up woman, and has friends and
doctors and nurses, and every one knows her need.
It seems to me that he might think that I have no
one but him, and that whatever might lie heavy
on my heart I could only confide in him. I have
always told him everything. Why doesn&#8217;t it occur
to him that I might have something to tell him
now? Why doesn&#8217;t he come to me?</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid he will get sick. He needs a good
deal of exercise to keep in form. If he doesn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
have a certain amount of muscular activity his
digestion is not so good. There are two little
creases between his eyes that I never remember
seeing there before. I asked him the other night
when he was here with Aunt Beulah if his head
ached, and he said &#8216;no,&#8217; but Aunt Beulah said her
head ached almost all the time. Of course, Aunt
Beulah is important, and if Uncle Peter is trying
to bring her back to normality again she is important
to him, and that makes her important to
me for his sake also, but nobody in the world is
worth the sacrifice of Uncle Peter. Nobody, nobody.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s a part of his great beauty that
he should think so disparagingly of himself. I
might not love him so well if he knew just how
dear and sweet and great his personality is. It
isn&#8217;t so much what he says or does, or even the
way he looks that constitutes his charm, it&#8217;s the
simple power and radiance behind his slightest
move. Oh! I can&#8217;t express it. He doesn&#8217;t think
he is especially fine or beautiful. He doesn&#8217;t know
what a waste it is when he spends his strength
upon somebody who isn&#8217;t as noble in character as
he is,&mdash;but I know, and it makes me wild to think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
of it. Oh! why doesn&#8217;t he come to me? My
vacation is almost over, and I don&#8217;t see how I
could bear going back to school without one comforting
hour of him alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I intended to write a detailed account of my
vacation, but I can not. Uncle Jimmie has certainly
tried to make me happy. He is so funny and dear.
I could have so much fun with him if I were not
worried about Uncle Peter!</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle David says he wants to spend my last
evening with me. We are going to dine here, and
then go to the theater together. I am going to
try to tell him how I feel about things, but I am
afraid he won&#8217;t give me the chance. Life is a
strange mixture of things you want and can&#8217;t have,
and things you can have and don&#8217;t want. It seems
almost disloyal to put that down on paper about
Uncle David. I do want him and love him, but
oh!&mdash;not in that way. Not in that way. There is
only one person in a woman&#8217;s life that she can
feel that way about. Why&mdash;why&mdash;why doesn&#8217;t
my Uncle Peter come to me?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Makings of a Triple Wedding</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Just by way of formality,&#8221; David said,
&#8220;and not because I think any one present&#8221;&mdash;he
smiled on the five friends grouped about
his dinner table&mdash;&#8220;still takes our old resolution
seriously, I should like to be released from the
anti-matrimonial pledge that I signed eight years
ago this November. I have no announcement to
make as yet, but when I do wish to make an announcement&mdash;and
I trust to have the permission
granted very shortly&mdash;I want to be sure of my
technical right to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh all Hemlocks!&#8221; Jimmie exclaimed in a
tone of such genuine confusion that it raised a
shout of laughter. &#8220;I never thought of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Peter. &#8220;I never signed any pledge
to that effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We left you out of it, Old Horse, regarding
you as a congenital celibate anyway,&#8221; Jimmie
answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some day soon you will understand how much
you wronged me,&#8221; Peter said with a covert glance
at Beulah.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could say as much,&#8221; Jimmie sighed,
&#8220;since this is the hour of confession I don&#8217;t mind
adding that I hope I may be able to soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gertrude clapped her hands softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful, wonderful!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
the makings of a triple wedding in our midst.
Look into the blushing faces before us and hear the
voice that breathed o&#8217;er Eden echoing in our ears.
This is the most exciting moment of my life!
Girls, get on your feet and drink to the health of
these about-to-be Benedicts. Up in your chairs,&mdash;one
slipper on the table. Now!&#8221;&mdash;and the moment
was saved.</p>
<p>Gertrude had seen Margaret&#8217;s sudden pallor and
heard the convulsive catching of her breath,&mdash;Margaret
rising Undine-like out of a filmy, pale
green frock, with her eyes set a little more deeply
in the shadows than usual. Her quick instinct to
the rescue was her own salvation.</p>
<p>David was on his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;On behalf of my coadjutors,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I thank
you. All this is extremely premature for me, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
I imagine from the confusion of the other gentlemen
present it is as much, if not more so, for
them. Personally I regret exceedingly being unable
to take you more fully into my confidence.
The only reason for this partial revelation is that
I wished to be sure that I was honorably released
from my oath of abstinence. Hang it all! You
fellows say something,&#8221; he concluded, sinking
abruptly into his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your style always was distinctly mid-Victorian,&#8221;
Jimmie murmured. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got nothing to
say, except that I wish I had something to say and
that if I <i>do</i> have something to say in the near
future I&#8217;ll create a real sensation! When Miss
Van Astorbilt permits David to link her name with
his in the caption under a double column cut in
our leading journals, you&#8217;ll get nothing like the
thrill that I expect to create with my modest announcement.
I&#8217;ve got a real romance up my
sleeve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;ve I, Jimmie. There is no Van Astorbilt
in mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some simple bar-maid then? A misalliance in
our midst. Now about you, Peter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady won&#8217;t give me her permission to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
speak,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;She knows how proud and
happy I shall be when I am able to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah looked up suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is better we should marry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t realize that when I exacted that oath from
you. It is from the intellectual type that the
brains to carry on the great work of the world
must be inherited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I pass,&#8221; Jimmie murmured. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the document
we signed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it. I&#8217;ll destroy it to-night and then we
may all consider ourselves free to take any step
that we see fit. It was really only as a further
protection to Eleanor that we signed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor will be surprised, won&#8217;t she?&#8221; Gertrude
suggested. Three self-conscious masculine faces
met her innocent interrogation.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Eleanor</i>,&#8221; Margaret breathed, &#8220;<i>Eleanor</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather think she will,&#8221; Jimmie chuckled irresistibly,
but David said nothing, and Peter stared
unseeingly into the glass he was still twirling on
its stem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor will be taken care of just the same,&#8221;
Beulah said decisively. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we need
even go through the formality of a vote on that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor will be taken care of,&#8221; David said
softly.</p>
<p>The Hutchinsons&#8217; limousine&mdash;old Grandmother
Hutchinson had a motor nowadays&mdash;was calling
for Margaret, and she was to take the two other
girls home. David and Jimmie&mdash;such is the nature
of men&mdash;were disappointed in not being able to
take Margaret and Gertrude respectively under
their accustomed protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to talk to you, Gertrude,&#8221; Jimmie said
reproachfully as she slipped away from his ingratiating
hand on her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I should take you home to-night,
Margaret,&#8221; David said; &#8220;you never gave me the
slip before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old order changeth,&#8221; Gertrude replied
lightly to them both, as she preceded Margaret
into the luxurious interior.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Eleanor,&#8221; Gertrude announced as the big
car swung into Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is Eleanor?&#8221; Margaret cried hysterically.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; Beulah asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie or David&mdash;or&mdash;or both are going to
marry Eleanor. Didn&#8217;t you see their faces when
Beulah spoke of her?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;David wants to marry Eleanor,&#8221; Margaret said
quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known it all winter&mdash;without realizing
what it was I knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, who is Jimmy going to marry then?&#8221;
Beulah inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Peter going to marry for that matter?&#8221;
Gertrude cut in. &#8220;Oh! it doesn&#8217;t make any difference,&mdash;we&#8217;re
losing them just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not necessarily,&#8221; Beulah said. &#8220;No matter
what combinations come about, we shall still have
an indestructible friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indestructible friendship&mdash;shucks,&#8221; Gertrude
cried. &#8220;The boys are going to be married&mdash;married&mdash;married!
Marriage is the one thing that indestructible
friendships don&#8217;t survive&mdash;except as ghosts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be Peter who is going to marry
Eleanor,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;It&#8217;s Peter who has
always loved her best. It&#8217;s Peter she cares for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a friend,&#8221; Beulah said, &#8220;as her dearest
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as a friend,&#8221; Margaret answered softly,
&#8220;she loves him. She has always loved him. It
comes early sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. I simply don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it,&#8221; Gertrude said. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
of it before. Of course, it must be Peter who is
going to marry her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t we&#8217;ve succeeded in working out a
rather tragic experiment,&#8221; Margaret said, &#8220;haven&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is a tragic experiment for any woman,&#8221;
Gertrude said sententiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peter doesn&#8217;t intend to marry Eleanor,&#8221; Beulah
persisted. &#8220;I happen to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you happen to know who he is going to
marry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do know, but I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever it is, it&#8217;s a mistake,&#8221; Margaret said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s our little Eleanor he wants. I suppose he
doesn&#8217;t realize it himself yet, and when he does
it will be too late. He&#8217;s probably gone and tied
himself up with somebody entirely unsuitable,
hasn&#8217;t he, Beulah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Beulah said; &#8220;perhaps he has.
I hadn&#8217;t thought of it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way to think of it, I know.&#8221; Margaret&#8217;s
eyes filled with sudden tears. &#8220;But whatever he&#8217;s
done it&#8217;s past mending now. There&#8217;ll be no question
of Peter&#8217;s backing out of a bargain&mdash;bad or
good, and our poor little kiddie&#8217;s got to suffer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Beulah took it hard,&#8221; Gertrude commented, as
they turned up-town again after dropping their
friend at her door. The two girls were spending
the night together at Margaret&#8217;s. &#8220;I wonder on
what grounds. I think besides being devoted to
Eleanor, she feels terrifically responsible for her.
She isn&#8217;t quite herself again either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is almost, thanks to Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;oh! I can&#8217;t pretend to think of anything
else,&mdash;who&mdash;who&mdash;who&mdash;are our boys going to
marry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Gertrude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you care?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a blow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always thought that you and David&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret met her eyes bravely but she did not
answer the implicit question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always thought that you and Jimmie&mdash;&#8221; she
said presently. &#8220;Oh! Gertrude, you would have
been so good for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s all over now,&#8221; Gertrude said, &#8220;but I
didn&#8217;t know that a living soul suspected me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you really hurt, dear?&#8221; Gertrude whispered
as they clung to each other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not really. It could have been&mdash;that&#8217;s all. He
could have made me care. I&#8217;ve never seen any one
else whom I thought that of. I&mdash;I was so used to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the rub,&#8221; Gertrude said, &#8220;we&#8217;re so used
to them. They&#8217;re so&mdash;so preposterously necessary
to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Late that night clasped in each other&#8217;s arms
they admitted the extent of their desolation. Life
had been robbed of a magic,&mdash;a mystery. The
solid friendship of years of mutual trust and understanding
was the background of so much lovely
folly, so many unrealized possibilities, so many
nebulous desires and dreams that the sudden dissolution
of their circle was an unthinkable calamity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to have put out our hands and taken
them if we wanted them,&#8221; Gertrude said, out of
the darkness. &#8220;Other women do. Probably these
other women have. Men are helpless creatures.
They need to be firmly turned in the right direction
instead of being given their heads. We&#8217;ve
been too good to our boys. We ought to have
snitched them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t pay that price for love,&#8221; Margaret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t. By the time I had made it
happen I wouldn&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my trouble too,&#8221; Gertrude said. Then
she turned over on her pillow and sobbed helplessly.
&#8220;Jimmie had such ducky little curls,&#8221; she
explained incoherently. &#8220;I do this sometimes
when I think of them. Otherwise, I&#8217;m not a crying
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret put out a hand to her; but long after
Gertrude&#8217;s breath began to rise and fall regularly,
she lay staring wide-eyed into the darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Eleanor Hears the News</span></h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Dear Uncle Jimmie:</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I would write you, but now that
I have taken this hour in which to do it, I find it
is a very, very hard letter that I have got to write.
In the first place I can&#8217;t believe that the things
you said to me that night were real, or that you
were awake and in the world of realities when you
said them. I felt as if we were both dreaming;
that you were talking as a man does sometimes in
delirium when he believes the woman he loves to
be by his side, and I was listening the same way.
It made me very happy, as dreams sometimes do.
I can&#8217;t help feeling that your idea of me is a dream
idea, and the pain that you said this kind of a
letter would give you will be merely dream pain.
It is a shock to wake up in the morning and find
that all the lovely ways we felt, and delicately
beautiful things we had, were only dream things
that we wouldn&#8217;t even understand if we were
thoroughly awake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the second place, you can&#8217;t want to marry
your little niecelet, the funny little &#8216;kiddo,&#8217; that used
to burn her fingers and the beefsteak over that old
studio gas stove. We had such lovely kinds of
make-believe together. That&#8217;s what our association
always ought to mean to us,&mdash;just chumship,
and wonderful and preposterous <i>pretends</i>. I
couldn&#8217;t think of myself being married to you any
more than I could Jack the giant killer, or Robinson
Crusoe. You&#8217;re my truly best and dearest
childhood&#8217;s playmate, and that is a great deal to
be, Uncle Jimmie. I don&#8217;t think a little girl ever
grows up quite <i>whole</i> unless she has somewhere,
somehow, what I had in you. You wouldn&#8217;t want
to marry Alice in Wonderland, now would you?
There are some kinds of playmates that can&#8217;t
marry each other. I think that you and I are that
kind, Uncle Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, my dear, don&#8217;t let this hurt you.
How can it hurt you, when I am only your little
adopted foster child that you have helped support
and comfort and make a beautiful, glad life for?
I love you so much,&mdash;you are so precious to me
that you <i>must</i> wake up out of this distorted, though
lovely dream that I was present at!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We must all be happy. Nobody can break our
hearts if we are strong enough to withhold them.
Nobody can hurt us too much if we can find the
way to be our bravest all the time. I know that
what you are feeling now is not real. I can&#8217;t tell
you how I know, but I do know the difference.
The roots are not deep enough. They could be
pulled up without too terrible a havoc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jimmie, dear, believe me, believe me. I
said this would be a hard letter to write, and it has
been. If you could see my poor inkstained, weeping
face, you would realize that I am only your funny
little Eleanor after all, and not to be taken seriously
at all. I hope you will come up for my graduation.
When you see me with all the other lumps and
frumps that are here, you will know that I am
not worth considering except as a kind of human
joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, dear, my dear, and God bless you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>It was less than a week after this letter to Jimmie
that Margaret spending a week-end in a town
in Connecticut adjoining that in which Eleanor&#8217;s
school was located, telephoned Eleanor to join her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
overnight at the inn where she was staying. She
had really planned the entire expedition for the
purpose of seeing Eleanor and preparing her for
the revelations that were in store for her, though
she was ostensibly meeting a motoring party, with
which she was going on into the Berkshires.</p>
<p>She started in abruptly, as was her way, over
the salad and cheese in the low studded Arts and
Crafts dining-room of the fashionable road house,
contrived to look as self-conscious as a pretty
woman in new sporting clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Uncle David and your Uncle Jimmie are
going to be married,&#8221; she told her. &#8220;Did you
know it, Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Eleanor said faintly, but she
grew suddenly very white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you surprised, dear? David gave a dinner
party one night last week in his studio, and
announced his intentions, but we don&#8217;t know the
name of the lady yet, and we can&#8217;t guess it. He
says it is not a society girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you think it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you think it is, Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t think, Aunt Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know who Jimmie is marrying either.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
The facts were merely insinuated, but he said we
should have the shock of our lives when we knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did he tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A week ago last Wednesday. I haven&#8217;t seen
him since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he has changed his mind by now,&#8221;
Eleanor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s likely. They were both
very much in earnest. Aren&#8217;t you surprised, Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know. Don&#8217;t you think it might be
that they both just thought they were going to
marry somebody&mdash;that really doesn&#8217;t want to
marry them? It might be all a mistake, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a mistake. David doesn&#8217;t
make mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might make one,&#8221; Eleanor persisted.</p>
<p>Margaret found the rest of her story harder to
tell than she had anticipated. Eleanor, wrapped
in the formidable aloofness of the sensitive young,
was already suffering from the tale she had come
to tell,&mdash;why, it was not so easy to determine. It
might be merely from the pang of being shut out
from confidences that she felt should have been
shared with her at once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>She waited until they were both ready for bed
(their rooms were connecting)&mdash;Eleanor in the
straight folds of her white dimity nightgown, and
her two golden braids making a picture that lingered
in Margaret&#8217;s memory for many years. &#8220;It
would have been easier to tell her in her street
clothes,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;I wish her profile were
not so perfect, or her eyes were shallower. How
can I hurt such a lovely thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the ten Hutchinsons all right?&#8221; Eleanor
was asking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ten Hutchinsons are very much all right.
They like me better now that I have grown a nice
hard Hutchinson shell that doesn&#8217;t show my feelings
through. Haven&#8217;t you noticed how much
more like other people I&#8217;ve grown, Eleanor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve grown nicer, and dearer and sweeter,
but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re very much like anybody
else, Aunt Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have though,&mdash;every one notices it. You
haven&#8217;t asked me anything about Peter yet,&#8221; she
added suddenly.</p>
<p>The lovely color glowed in Eleanor&#8217;s cheeks for
an instant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is Uncle Peter well?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
heard from him for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s well,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;He&#8217;s looking
better than he was for a while. He had some news
to tell us too, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor put her hand to her throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of news?&#8221; she asked huskily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to be married too. It came out
when the others told us. He said that he hadn&#8217;t
the consent of the lady to mention her name yet.
We&#8217;re as much puzzled about him as we are about
the other two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Aunt Beulah,&#8221; Eleanor said. &#8220;It&#8217;s Aunt
Beulah.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat upright on the edge of the bed and
stared straight ahead of her. Margaret watched
the light and life and youth die out of the face
and a pitiful ashen pallor overspread it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s Beulah,&#8221; Margaret said.
&#8220;Beulah knows who it is, but I never thought of
it&#8217;s being Beulah herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she knows&mdash;then she&#8217;s the one. He wouldn&#8217;t
have told her first if she hadn&#8217;t been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it hurt you too much, dear. We&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
all hurt some, you know. Gertrude&mdash;and me, too,
Eleanor. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s pain to us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;Uncle David, Aunt Margaret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dear,&#8221; Margaret smiled at her bravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;And does Aunt Gertrude care about Uncle
Jimmie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has for a good many years, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wish somebody
had told me.&#8221; She pushed Margaret&#8217;s arm
away from her gently, but her breath came hard.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I can&#8217;t bear it. You
might not want to&mdash;if you knew. Please go,&mdash;oh!
please go&mdash;oh! please go.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Margaret closed the door gently between
them, she saw Eleanor throw her head back, and
push the back of her hand hard against her mouth,
as if to stifle the rising cry of her anguish.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>The next morning Eleanor was gone. Margaret
had listened for hours in the night but had heard
not so much as the rustle of a garment from the
room beyond. Toward morning she had fallen
into the sleep of exhaustion. It was then that the
stricken child had made her escape. &#8220;Miss Hamlin
had found that she must take the early train,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
the clerk said, &#8220;and left this note for Miss Hutchinson.&#8221;
It was like Eleanor to do things decently
and in order.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;Dear Aunt Margaret,&#8221; her letter ran. &#8220;My
grandmother used to say that some people were
trouble breeders. On thinking it over I am afraid
that is just about what I am,&mdash;a trouble breeder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a worry and bother and care to you
all since the beginning, and I have repaid all your
kindness by bringing trouble upon you. Perhaps
you can guess what I mean. I don&#8217;t think I have
any right to tell you exactly in this letter. I can
only pray that it will be found to be all a mistake,
and come out right in the end. Surely such beautiful
people as you and Uncle David can find the
way to each other, and can help Uncle Jimmie and
Aunt Gertrude, who are a little blinder about life.
Surely, when the stumbling block is out of the
way, you four will walk together beautifully.
Please try, Aunt Margaret, to make things as right
as if I had never helped them to go wrong. I was
so young, I didn&#8217;t know how to manage. I shall
never be that kind of young again. I grew up
last night, Aunt Margaret.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You know the other reason why I am going.
Please do not let any one else know. If the others
could think I had met with some accident, don&#8217;t
you think that would be the wisest way? I would
like to arrange it so they wouldn&#8217;t try to find me
at all, but would just mourn for me naturally for
a little while. I thought of sticking my old cap
in the river, but I was afraid that would be too
hard for you. There won&#8217;t be any use in trying
to find me. I am going where you can not. I
couldn&#8217;t ever bear seeing one of your faces again.
I have done too much harm. Don&#8217;t let Uncle
Peter <i>know</i>, please, Aunt Margaret. I don&#8217;t want
him to know,&mdash;I don&#8217;t want to hurt him, and I
don&#8217;t want him to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I have loved you all so much. Good-by,
my dears, my dearests. I have taken all of my
allowance money. Please forgive me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Search</span></h3>
</div>
<p>Eleanor had not bought a ticket at the station,
Margaret ascertained, but the ticket
agent had tried to persuade her to. She had
thanked him and told him that she preferred to buy
it of the conductor. He was a lank, saturnine
individual and had been seriously smitten with
Eleanor&#8217;s charms, it appeared, and the extreme
solicitousness of his attitude at the suggestion of
any mystery connected with her departure made
Margaret realize the caution with which it would
be politic to proceed. She had very little hope of
finding Eleanor back at the school, but it was still
rather a shock when she telephoned the school
office and found that there was no news of her
there. She concocted a somewhat lame story to
account for Eleanor&#8217;s absence and promised the
authorities that she would be sent back to them
within the week,&mdash;a promise she was subsequently
obliged to acknowledge that she could not keep.
Then she fled to New York to break the disastrous
news to the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>She told Gertrude the truth and showed her the
pitiful letter Eleanor had left behind her, and together
they wept over it. Also together, they
faced David and Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;She went away,&#8221; Margaret told them, &#8220;both
because she felt she was hurting those that she
loved and because she herself was hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; David asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean&mdash;that she belonged body and soul to
Peter and to nobody else,&#8221; Margaret answered
deliberately.</p>
<p>David bowed his head. Then he threw it back
again, suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is true,&#8221; he said, &#8220;then I am largely
responsible for her going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I who am responsible,&#8221; Jimmie groaned
aloud. &#8220;I asked her to marry me and she refused
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked her to marry me and didn&#8217;t give her
the chance to refuse,&#8221; David said; &#8220;it is that she
is running away from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Peter&#8217;s engagement that was the last
straw,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;The poor baby withered
and shrank like a flower in the blast when I told
her that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The damned hound&mdash;&#8221; Jimmie said feelingly
and without apology. &#8220;Who&#8217;s he engaged to anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eleanor says it&#8217;s Beulah, and the more I think
of it the more I think that she&#8217;s probably right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a nice mess, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Gertrude
suggested. &#8220;Remember how frank we were
with her about his probable lack of judgment, Margaret?
I don&#8217;t covet the sweet job of breaking
it to either one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless she assisted Margaret to break it
to them both late that same afternoon at Beulah&#8217;s
apartment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find her,&#8221; Peter said briefly. And in response
to the halting explanation of her disappearance
that Margaret and Gertrude had done their
best to try to make plausible, despite its elliptical
nature, he only said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it makes any
difference why she&#8217;s gone. She&#8217;s gone, that&#8217;s the
thing that&#8217;s important. No matter how hard we
try we can&#8217;t really figure out her reason till we
find her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure it&#8217;s going to be so easy?&#8221; Gertrude
asked. &#8220;I mean&mdash;finding her. She&#8217;s a pretty
determined little person when she makes up her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
mind. Eleanor&#8217;s threats are to be taken seriously.
She always makes good on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find her if she&#8217;s anywhere in the world,&#8221;
Peter said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll find her and bring her back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret put out her hand to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that you will,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Find out
the reason that she went away, too, Peter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beulah pulled Gertrude aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t Peter, was it?&#8221; she asked piteously.
&#8220;She had some one else on her mind, hadn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She had something else on her mind,&#8221; Gertrude
answered gravely, &#8220;but she had Peter on her mind,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t&mdash;she couldn&#8217;t have known about
us&mdash;Peter and me. We&mdash;we haven&#8217;t told any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She guessed it, Beulah. She couldn&#8217;t bear it.
Nobody&#8217;s to blame. It&#8217;s just one of God&#8217;s most
satirical mix-ups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was to blame,&#8221; Beulah said slowly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
believe in shifting responsibility. I got her here
in the first place and I&#8217;ve been instrumental in
guiding her life ever since. Now, I&#8217;ve sacrificed
her to my own happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so simple as that,&#8221; Gertrude said; &#8220;the
things we start going soon pass out of our hands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
Somebody a good deal higher up has been directing
Eleanor&#8217;s affairs for a long time,&mdash;and ours too,
for that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Beulah,&#8221; Peter said, making his
way to her side from the other corner of the room
where he had been talking to Margaret. &#8220;You
mustn&#8217;t let this worry you. We&#8217;ve all got to be&mdash;soldiers
now,&mdash;but we&#8217;ll soon have her back again,
I promise you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I promise you,&#8221; Beulah said chokingly,
&#8220;that if you&#8217;ll get her back again, I&mdash;I will be a
soldier.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Peter began by visiting the business schools in
New York and finding out the names of the pupils
registered there. Eleanor had clung firmly to her
idea of becoming an editorial stenographer in some
magazine office, no matter how hard he had worked
to dissuade her. He felt almost certain she would
follow out that purpose now. There was a fund
in her name started some years before for the
defraying of her college expenses. She would use
that, he argued, to get herself started, even though
she felt constrained to pay it back later on. He
worked on this theory for some time, even making
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
a trip to Boston in search for her in the stenography
classes there, but nothing came of it.</p>
<p>Among Eleanor&#8217;s effects sent on from the school
was a little red address book containing the names
and addresses of many of her former schoolmates
at Harmon. Peter wrote all the girls he remembered
hearing her speak affectionately of, but not
one of them was able to give him any news of her.
He wrote to Colhassett to Albertina&#8217;s aunt, who had
served in the capacity of housekeeper to Eleanor&#8217;s
grandfather in his last days, and got in reply a
pious letter from Albertina herself, who intimated
that she had always suspected that Eleanor would
come to some bad end, and that now she was
highly soothed and gratified by the apparent fulfillment
of her sinister prognostications.</p>
<p>Later he tried private detectives, and, not content
with their efforts, he followed them over the
ground that they covered, searching through boarding
houses, and public classes of all kinds; canvassing
the editorial offices of the various magazines
Eleanor had admired in the hope of discovering
that she had applied for some small position there;
following every clue that his imagination, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
acumen of the professionals in his service, could
supply;&mdash;but his patient search was unrewarded.
Eleanor had apparently vanished from the surface
of the earth. The quest which had seemed to him
so simple a matter when he first undertook it, now
began to assume terrible and abortive proportions.
It was unthinkable that one little slip of a girl
untraveled and inexperienced should be able permanently
to elude six determined and worldly
adult New Yorkers, who were prepared to tax
their resources to the utmost in the effort to find
her,&mdash;but the fact remained that she was missing
and continued to be missing, and the cruel month
went by and brought them no news of her.</p>
<p>The six guardians took their trouble hard. Apart
from the emotions that had been precipitated by
her developing charms, they loved her dearly as
the child they had taken to their hearts and bestowed
all their young enthusiasm and energy and
tenderness upon. She was the living clay, as Gertrude
had said so many years before, that they
had molded as nearly as possible to their hearts&#8217;
desire. They loved her for herself, but one and
all they loved her for what they had made of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
her&mdash;an exquisite, lovely young creature, at ease
in a world that might so easily have crushed her
utterly if they had not intervened for her.</p>
<p>They kept up the search unremittingly, following
false leads and meeting with heartbreaking discouragements
and disappointments. Only Margaret
had any sense of peace about her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I feel it.
It&#8217;s hard having her gone, but I&#8217;m not afraid for
her. She&#8217;ll work it out better than we could help
her to. It&#8217;s a beautiful thing to be young and
strong and free, and she&#8217;ll get the beauty out of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think perhaps you&#8217;re right, Margaret,&#8221; David
said. &#8220;You almost always are. It&#8217;s the bread and
butter end of the problem that worries me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret smiled at him quaintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord provides,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;ll provide
for our ewe lamb, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak as if you had it on direct authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think perhaps I have,&#8221; she said gravely.</p>
<p>Jimmie and Gertrude grew closer together as
the weeks passed, and the strain of their fruitless
quest continued. One day Jimmie showed her the
letter that Eleanor had written him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sweet, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; he said, as Gertrude returned
it to him, smiling through her tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a darling,&#8221; Gertrude said fervently. &#8220;Did
she hurt you so much, Jimmie dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted her,&#8221; Jimmie answered slowly, &#8220;but
I think it was because I thought she was mine,&mdash;that
I could make her mine. When I found she
was Peter&#8217;s,&mdash;had been Peter&#8217;s all the time, the
thought somehow cured me. She was dead right,
you know. I made it up out of the stuff that
dreams are made of. God knows I love her, but&mdash;but
that personal thing has gone out of it. She&#8217;s
my little lost child,&mdash;or my sister. A man wants
his own to be his own, Gertrude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;my real trouble is that I&#8217;m at sea again.
I thought that I cared,&mdash;that I was anchored for
good. It&#8217;s the drifting that plays the deuce with
me. If the thought of that sweet child and the
grief at her loss can&#8217;t hold me, what can? What
hope is there for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Gertrude laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t laugh at me. You&#8217;ve always been on to
me, Gertrude, too much so to have any respect for
me, I guess. You&#8217;ve got your work,&#8221; he waved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
his arm at the huge cast under the shadow of
which they were sitting, &#8220;and all this. You can
put all your human longings into it. I&#8217;m a poor
rudderless creature without any hope or direction.&#8221;
He buried his face in his hands. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know
it,&#8221; he said, with an effort to conceal the fact that
his shoulders were shaking, &#8220;but you see before
you a human soul in the actual process of dissolution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gertrude crossed her studio floor to kneel down
beside him. She drew the boyish head, rumpled
into an irresistible state of curliness, to her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it here where it belongs,&#8221; she said softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Sure thing?
Hope to die? Cross your heart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Praise the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I snitched him,&#8221; Gertrude confided to Margaret
some days later,&mdash;her whole being radiant and
transfigured with happiness. &#8220;You snitch David.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Young Nurse</span></h3>
</div>
<p>The local hospital of the village of Harmonville,
which was ten miles from Harmon
proper, where the famous boarding-school for
young ladies was located, presented an aspect so
far from institutional that but for the sign board
tacked modestly to an elm tree just beyond the
break in the hedge that constituted the main entrance,
the gracious, old colonial structure might
have been taken for the private residence for
which it had served so many years.</p>
<p>It was a crisp day in late September, and a
pale yellow sun was spread thin over the carpet
of yellow leaves with which the wide lawn was
covered. In the upper corridor of the west wing,
grouped about the window-seat with their embroidery
or knitting, the young nurses were talking
together in low tones during the hour of the
patients&#8217; siestas. The two graduates, dark-eyed
efficient girls, with skilled delicate fingers taking
precise stitches in the needlework before them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
were in full uniform, but the younger girls clustered
about them, beginners for the most part, but
a few months in training, were dressed in the
simple blue print, and little white caps and aprons,
of the probationary period.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was very quiet and peaceful.
A light breeze blew in at the window and stirred
a straying lock or two that escaped the starched
band of a confining cap. Outside the stinging
whistle of the insect world was interrupted now
and then by the cough of a passing motor. From
the doors opening on the corridor an occasional
restless moan indicated the inability of some sufferer
to take his dose of oblivion according to
schedule. Presently a bell tinkled a summons to
the patient in the first room on the right&mdash;a gentle
little old lady who had just had her appendix
removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you take that, Miss Hamlin?&#8221; the nurse
in charge of the case asked the tallest and fairest
of the young assistants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221; Eleanor, demure in cap and kerchief
as the most ravishing of young Priscillas,
rose obediently at the request. &#8220;May I read to
her a little if she wants me to?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if you keep the door closed. I think
most of the others are sleeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little old lady who had just had her appendix
out, smiled weakly up at Eleanor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped &#8217;twould be you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and then
after I&#8217;d rung I lay in fear and trembling lest one
o&#8217; them young flipperti-gibbets should come, and
get me all worked up while she was trying to
shift me. I want to be turned the least little mite
on my left side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Eleanor asked, as she
made the adjustment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno whether that&#8217;s better, or whether it
just seems better to me, because &#8217;twas you that
fixed me,&#8221; the little old lady said. &#8220;You certainly
have got a soothin&#8217; and comfortin&#8217; way with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to take care of my grandmother years
ago, and the more hospital work I do, the more
it comes back to me,&mdash;and the better I remember
the things that she liked to have done for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody like your own kith and kin,&#8221;
the little old lady sighed. &#8220;There&#8217;s none left of
mine. That other nurse&mdash;that black haired one&mdash;she
said you was an orphan, alone in the world.
Well, I pity a young girl alone in the world.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right to be alone in the world&mdash;if you
just keep busy enough,&#8221; Eleanor said. &#8220;But you
mustn&#8217;t talk any more. I&#8217;m going to give you
your medicine and then sit here and read to you.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>On the morning of her flight from the inn,
after a night spent staring motionless into the
darkness, Eleanor took the train to the town some
dozen miles beyond Harmonville, where her old
friend Bertha Stephens lived. To &#8220;Stevie,&#8221; to
whom the duplicity of Maggie Lou had served to
draw her very close in the ensuing year, she told
a part of her story. It was through the influence
of Mrs. Stephens, whose husband was on the
board of directors of the Harmonville hospital,
that Eleanor had been admitted there. She had
resolutely put all her old life behind her. The
plan to take up a course in stenography and enter
an editorial office was to have been, as a matter
of course, a part of her life closely associated with
Peter. Losing him, there was nothing left of her
dream of high adventure and conquest. There was
merely the hurt desire to hide herself where she
need never trouble him again, and where she could
be independent and useful. Having no idea of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
her own value to her guardians, or the integral
tenderness in which she was held, she sincerely
believed that her disappearance must have relieved
them of much chagrin and embarrassment.</p>
<p>Her hospital training kept her mercifully busy.
She had the temperament that finds a virtue in
the day&#8217;s work, and a balm in its mere iterative
quality. Her sympathy and intelligence made her
a good nurse and her adaptability, combined with
her loveliness, a general favorite.</p>
<p>She spent her days off at the Stephens&#8217; home.
Bertha Stephens had been the one girl that Peter
had failed to write to, when he began to circulate
his letters of inquiry. Her name had been set
down in the little red book, but he remembered
the trouble that Maggie Lou had precipitated, and
arrived at the conclusion that the intimacy existing
between Eleanor and Bertha had not survived it.
Except that Carlo Stephens persisted in trying to
make love to her, and Mrs. Stephens covertly
encouraged his doing so, Eleanor found the
Stephens&#8217; home a very comforting haven. Bertha
had developed into a full breasted, motherly looking
girl, passionately interested in all vicarious
love-affairs, though quickly intimidated at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
thought of having any of her own. She was devoted
to Eleanor, and mothered her clumsily.</p>
<p>It was still to her diary that Eleanor turned for
the relief and solace of self-expression.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;It is five months to-day,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;since I
came to the hospital. It seems like five years. I
like it, but I feel like the little old woman on the
King&#8217;s Highway. I doubt more every minute if
this can be I. Sometimes I wonder what &#8216;being I&#8217;
consists of, anyway. I used to feel as if I were
divided up into six parts as separate as protoplasmic
cells, and that each one was looked out for by
a different cooperative parent. I thought that I
would truly be I when I got them all together,
and looked out for them myself, but I find I am
no more of an entity than I ever was. The puzzling
question of &#8216;what am I?&#8217; still persists, and I
am farther away from the right answer than ever.
Would a sound be a sound if there were no one
to hear it? If the waves of vibration struck no
human ear, would the sound be in existence at all?
This is the problem propounded by one of the
nurses yesterday.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How much of us lives when we are entirely
shut out of the consciousness of those whom we
love? If there is no one to <i>realize</i> us day by day,&mdash;if
all that love has made of us is taken away,
what is left? Is there anything? I don&#8217;t know.
I look in the glass, and see the same face,&mdash;Eleanor
Hamlin, almost nineteen, with the same
bow shaped eyebrows, and the same double ridge
leading up from her nose to her mouth, making
her look still very babyish. I pinch myself, and
find that it hurts just the same as it used to six
months ago, but there the resemblance to what I
used to be, stops. I&#8217;m a young nurse now in
hospital training, and very good at it, too, if I
do say it as shouldn&#8217;t; but that&#8217;s all I am. Otherwise,
I&#8217;m not anybody <i>to</i> anybody,&mdash;except a
figure of romance to good old Stevie, who doesn&#8217;t
count in this kind of reckoning. I take naturally
to nursing they tell me. A nurse is a kind of
maternal automaton. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m that, but there
used to be a lot more of me than that. There
ought to be some heart and brain and soul left
over, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be. Perhaps I
am like the Princess in the fairy story whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
heart was an auk&#8217;s egg. Nobody had power to
make her feel unless they reached it and
squeezed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sometimes as if I were dead. I wish I
could know whether Uncle Peter and Aunt Beulah
were married yet. I wish I could know that.
There is a woman in this hospital whose suitor
married some one else, and she has nervous prostration,
and melancholia. All she does all day is
to moan and wring her hands and call out his
name. The nurses are not very sympathetic. They
seem to think that it is disgraceful to love a man
so much that your whole life stops as soon as he
goes out of it. What of Juliet and Ophelia and
Francesca de Rimini? They loved so they could
not tear their love out of their hearts without
lacerating them forever. There is that kind of
love in the world,&mdash;bigger than life itself. All the
big tragedies of literature were made from it,&mdash;why
haven&#8217;t people more sympathy for it? Why
isn&#8217;t there more dignity about it in the eyes of the
world?</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very unlucky to love, and to lose that
which you cherish, but it is unluckier still never
to know the meaning of love, or to find &#8216;Him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
whom your soul loveth.&#8217; I try to be kind to that
poor forsaken woman. I am sorry for his sake
that she calls out his name, but she seems to be in
such torture of mind and body that she is unable
to help it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are trying to cut down expenses here, so
they have no regular cook, the housekeeper and
her helper are supposed to do it all. I said I
would make the desserts, so now I have got to go
down-stairs and make some fruit gelatin. It is
best that I should not write any more to-day, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Later, after the Thanksgiving holiday, she
wrote:</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;I saw a little boy butchered to-day, and I shall
never forget it. It is wicked to speak of Doctor
Blake&#8217;s clean cut work as butchery, but when you
actually see a child&#8217;s leg severed from its body,
what else can you call it?</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason that I am able to go through operations
without fainting or crying is just this: <i>other
people do</i>. The first time I stood by the operating
table to pass the sterilized instruments to the
assisting nurse, and saw the half naked doctors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
hung in rubber standing there preparing to carve
their way through the naked flesh of the unconscious
creature before them, I felt the kind of
pang pass through my heart that seems to kill as
it comes. I thought I died, or was dying,&mdash;and
then I looked up and saw that every one else was
ready for their work. So I drew a deep breath
and became ready too. I don&#8217;t think there is
anything in the world too hard to do if you look
at it that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little boy loved me and I loved him. We
had hoped against hope that we would be able to
save his poor little leg, but it had to go. I held
his hand while they gave him the chloroform. At
his head sat Doctor Hathaway with his Christlike
face, draped in the robe of the anesthetist. &#8216;Take
long breaths, Benny,&#8217; I said, and he breathed in
bravely. It was over quickly. To-morrow, when
he is really out of the ether, I have got to tell
him what was done to him. Something happened
to me while that operation was going on. He
hasn&#8217;t any mother. I think the spirit of the one
who was his mother passed into me, and I knew
what it would be like to be the mother of a son.
Benny was not without what his mother would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
have felt for him if she had been at his side. I
can&#8217;t explain it, but that is what I felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night it is as black as ink outside. There
are no stars. I feel as if there should be no stars.
If there were, there might be some strange little
bit of comfort in them that I could cling to. I
do not want any comfort from outside to shine
upon me to-night. I have got to draw all my
strength from a source within, and I feel it welling
up within me even now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I have been selfish to leave the
people I love so long without any word of me.
I think Aunt Gertrude and Aunt Beulah and Aunt
Margaret all had a mother feeling for me. I
am remembering to-night how anxious they used to
be for me to have warm clothing, and to keep my
feet dry, and not to work too hard at school. All
those things that I took as a matter of course, I
realize now were very significant and beautiful.
If I had a child and did not know to-night where
it would lie down to sleep, or on what pillow it
would put its head, I know my own rest would be
troubled. I wonder if I have caused any one of
my dear mothers to feel like that. If I have, it
has been very wicked and cruel of me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Christmas Again</span></h3>
</div>
<p>The ten Hutchinsons having left the library
entirely alone in the hour before dinner,
David and Margaret had appropriated it and were
sitting companionably together on the big couch
drawn up before the fireplace, where a log was
trying to consume itself unscientifically head first.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would stay to dinner if urged,&#8221; David suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay,&#8221; Margaret agreed laconically.</p>
<p>She moved away from him, relaxing rather
limply in the corner of the couch, with a hand
dangling over the farther edge of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an inconsistent being,&#8221; David said.
&#8220;You buoy all the rest of us up with your faith in
the well-being of our child, and then you pine
yourself sick over her absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Christmas coming on. We always had
such a beautiful time on Christmas. It was so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
much fun buying her presents. It isn&#8217;t like Christmas
at all with her gone from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember how crazy she was over
the ivory set?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the bracelet watch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the Juliet costume?&#8221; David&#8217;s
eyes kindled at the reminiscence. &#8220;How wonderful
she was in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret drew her feet up on the couch suddenly,
and clasped her hands about her knees.
David laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you do that for years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hump yourself in that cryptic way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was just wondering&mdash;&#8221;
but she stopped herself suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wondering what?&#8221; David was watching her
narrowly, and perceiving it, she flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not my idea of an interesting conversation,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;it&#8217;s getting too personal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can remember the time when you told me
that you didn&#8217;t find things interesting unless they
were personal. &#8216;I like things very personal,&#8217; you
said&mdash;in those words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What has changed you?&#8221; David asked gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chill wind of the world, I guess; the most
personal part of me is frozen stiff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw a warmer creature in my life,&#8221;
David protested. &#8220;On that same occasion you
said that being a woman was about like being a
field of clover in an insectless world. You don&#8217;t
feel that way nowadays, surely,&mdash;at the rate the
insects have been buzzing around you this winter.
I&#8217;ve counted at least seven, three bees, one or two
beetles, a butterfly and a worm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you paid that much attention to
my poor affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, though. If you hadn&#8217;t put your foot
down firmly on the worm, I had every intention
of doing so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On that occasion to which you refer I remember
I also said that I had a queer hunch about
Eleanor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret, are you deliberately changing the
subject?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall bring the butterfly up later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said,&#8221; Margaret ignored his interruption, &#8220;that
I had the feeling that she was going to be a
storm center and bring some kind of queer trouble
upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure that&#8217;s the way to put it,&#8221;
David said gravely. &#8220;We brought queer trouble
on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She made&mdash;you&mdash;suffer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She gave my vanity the worst blow it has ever
had in its life,&#8221; David corrected her. &#8220;Look here,
Margaret, I want you to know the truth about that.
I&mdash;I stumbled into that, you know. She was so
sweet, and before I knew it I had&mdash;I found myself
in the attitude of making love to her. Well, there
was nothing to do but go through with it. I
wanted to, of course. I felt like Pygmalion&mdash;but
it was all potential, unrealized&mdash;and ass that I
was, I assumed that she would have no other idea
in the matter. I was going to marry her because
I&mdash;I had started things going, you know. I had
no choice even if I had wanted one. It never occurred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
to me that she might have a choice, and so
I went on trying to make things easy for her,
and getting them more tangled at every turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never really&mdash;cared?&#8221; Margaret&#8217;s face was
in shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never got the chance to find out. With characteristic
idiocy I was keeping out of the picture
until the time was ripe. She really ran away to
get away from the situation I created and she was
quite right too. If I weren&#8217;t haunted by these
continual pictures of our offspring in the bread
line, I should be rather glad than otherwise that
she&#8217;s shaken us all till we get our breath back.
Poor Peter is the one who is smashed, though. He
hasn&#8217;t smiled since she went away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t smile if you were engaged to
Beulah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they still engaged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beulah has her ring, but I notice she doesn&#8217;t
wear it often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie and Gertrude seem happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are, gloriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That leaves only us two,&#8221; David suggested.
&#8220;Margaret, dear, do you think the time will ever
come when I shall get you back again?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>Margaret turned a little pale, but she met his
look steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever lose me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer to that is &#8216;yes,&#8217; as you very well
know. Time was when we were very close&mdash;you
and I, then somehow we lost the way to each
other. I&#8217;m beginning to realize that it hasn&#8217;t
been the same world since and isn&#8217;t likely to be unless
you come back to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it I who strayed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was I; but it was you who put the bars up
and have kept them there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was I to let the bars down and wait at the
gate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If need be. It should be that way between us,
Margaret, shouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Margaret said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
She flashed a sudden odd look at him. &#8220;If&mdash;when
I put the bars down, I shall run for my life. I
give you warning, David.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Warning is all I want,&#8221; David said contentedly.
He could barely reach her hand across the intervening
expanse of leather couch, but he accomplished
it,&mdash;he was too wise to move closer
to her. &#8220;You&#8217;re a lovely, lovely being,&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
reverently. &#8220;God grant I may reach you and
hold you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She curled a warm little finger about his.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would Mrs. Bolling say?&#8221; she asked
practically.</p>
<p>&#8220;To tell you the truth, she spoke of it the other
day. I told her the Eleanor story, and that rather
brought her to her senses. She wouldn&#8217;t have
liked that, you know; but now all the eligible buds
are plucked, and she wants me to settle down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she think I&#8217;m a settling kind of person?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t if she knew the way you go to
my head,&#8221; David murmured. &#8220;Oh, she thinks
that you&#8217;ll do. She likes the ten Hutchinsons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;d like them better considered as connections
of yours,&#8221; Margaret said abstractedly.</p>
<p>David lifted the warm little finger to his lips
and kissed it swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; he asked, as she slipped
away from him and stood poised in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to put on something appropriate to
the occasion,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>When she came back to him she was wearing
the most delicate and cobwebby of muslins with a
design of pale purple passion flowers trellised all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
over it, and she gave him no chance for a moment
alone with her all the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>Sometime later she showed him Eleanor&#8217;s parting
letter, and he was profoundly touched by the
pathetic little document.</p>
<p>As the holidays approached Eleanor&#8217;s absence
became an almost unendurable distress to them all.
The annual Christmas dinner party, a function
that had never been omitted since the acquisition
of David&#8217;s studio, was decided on conditionally,
given up, and again decided on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do want to see one another on Christmas
day,&mdash;we&#8217;ve got presents for one another, and
Eleanor would hate it if she thought that her
going away had settled that big a cloud on us.
She slipped out of our lives in order to bring us
closer together. We&#8217;ll get closer together for her
sake,&#8221; Margaret decided.</p>
<p>But the ordeal of the dinner itself was almost
more than they had reckoned on. Every detail of
traditional ceremony was observed even to the
mound of presents marked with each name piled
on the same spot on the couch, to be opened with
the serving of the coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got something for Eleanor,&#8221; Jimmie remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
shamefacedly as he added his contributions
to the collection. &#8220;Thought we could keep it for
her, or throw it into the waste-basket or something.
Anyhow I had to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess everybody else got her something, too,&#8221;
Margaret said. &#8220;Of course we will keep them for
her. I got her a little French party coat. It will
be just as good next year as this. Anyhow as
Jimmie says, I had to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got her slipper buckles,&#8221; Gertrude admitted.
&#8220;She has always wanted them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got her the Temple <i>Shakespeare</i>,&#8221; Beulah
added. &#8220;She was always carrying around those
big volumes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking better, Beulah,&#8221; Margaret said.
&#8220;Are you feeling better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie says I&#8217;m looking more human. I
guess perhaps that&#8217;s it,&mdash;I&#8217;m feeling more&mdash;human.
I needed humanizing&mdash;even at the expense
of some&mdash;some heartbreak,&#8221; she said
bravely.</p>
<p>Margaret crossed the room to take a seat on
Beulah&#8217;s chair-arm, and slipped an arm around
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right if you know that,&#8221; she
whispered softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I was going to bring you Eleanor
herself,&#8221; Peter said. &#8220;I got on the trail of a girl
working in a candy shop out in Yonkers. My
faithful sleuth was sure it was Eleanor and I was
ass enough to believe he knew what he was talking
about. When I got out there I found a strawberry
blonde with gold teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, you don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s doing anything like
that,&#8221; Jimmie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Peter said miserably. He was
looking ill and unlike himself. His deep set gray
eyes were sunken far in his head, his brow was
too white, and the skin drawn too tightly over his
jaws. &#8220;As a de-tec-i-tive, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m a
failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all failures for that matter,&#8221; David said.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s have dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor&#8217;s empty place, set with the liqueur glass
she always drank her thimbleful of champagne in,
and the throne chair from the drawing-room in
which she presided over the feasts given in her
honor, was almost too much for them. Margaret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
cried openly over her soup. Peter shaded his
eyes with his hand, and Gertrude and Jimmie
groped for each other&#8217;s hands under the shelter
of the table-cloth.</p>
<p>&#8220;This&mdash;this won&#8217;t do,&#8221; David said. He turned
to Beulah on his left, sitting immovable, with her
eyes staring unseeingly into the centerpiece of
holly and mistletoe arranged by Alphonse so lovingly.
&#8220;We must either turn this into a kind of
a wake, and kneel as we feast, or we must try to
rise above it somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why,&#8221; Jimmie argued. &#8220;I&#8217;m in
favor of each man howling informally as he
listeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s drink her health anyhow,&#8221; David insisted.
&#8220;I cut out the Sauterne and the claret, so we could
begin on the wine at once in this contingency.
Here&#8217;s to our beloved and dear absent daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Long may she wave,&#8221; Jimmie cried, stumbling
to his feet an instant after the others.</p>
<p>While they were still standing with their glasses
uplifted, the bell rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let anybody in, Alphonse,&#8221; David admonished
him.</p>
<p>They all turned in the direction of the hall, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
there was no sound of parley at the front door.
Eleanor had put a warning finger to her lips, as
Alphonse opened it to find her standing there. She
stripped off her hat and her coat as she passed
through the drawing-room, and stood in her little
blue cloth traveling dress between the porti&egrave;res that
separated it from the dining-room. The six stood
transfixed at the sight of her, not believing the
vision of their eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re drinking my health,&#8221; she cried, as she
stretched out her arms to them. &#8220;Oh! my dears,
and my dearests, will you forgive me for running
away from you?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Lover</span></h3>
</div>
<p>They left her alone with Peter in the drawing
room in the interval before the coffee,
seeing that he had barely spoken to her though his
eyes had not left her face since the moment of her
spectacular appearance between the porti&egrave;res.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to marry you, Peter,&#8221; Beulah
whispered, as she slipped by him to the door,
&#8220;don&#8217;t think of me. Think of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Peter was almost past coherent thought or
speech as they stood facing each other on the
hearth-rug,&mdash;Eleanor&#8217;s little head up and her
breath coming lightly between her sweet, parted
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you go?&#8221; Peter groaned. &#8220;How
could you, dear&mdash;how could you,&mdash;how could
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back all safe, now, Uncle Peter. I took
up nursing in a hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even find you. I swore that I would.
I&#8217;ve searched for you everywhere.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I made you all that trouble,&#8221; Eleanor
said, &#8220;but I thought it would be the best thing
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me why,&#8221; Peter said, &#8220;tell me why, I&#8217;ve
suffered so much&mdash;wondering&mdash;wondering.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve suffered?&#8221; Eleanor cried. &#8220;I thought
it was only I who did the suffering.&#8221;</p>
<p>She moved a step nearer to him, and Peter
gripped her hard by the shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that you cared?&#8221; he said. Then his
lips met hers dumbly, beseechingly.</p>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>&#8220;It was all a mistake,&mdash;my going away,&#8221; she
wrote some days after. &#8220;I ought to have stayed
at the school, and graduated, and then come down
to New York, and faced things. I have my lesson
now about facing things. If any other crisis
comes into my life, I hope I shall be as strong
as Dante was, when he &#8216;showed himself more
furnished with breath than he was,&#8217; and said, &#8216;Go
on, for I am strong and resolute.&#8217; I think we always
have more strength than we understand ourselves
to have.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so wonderfully happy about Uncle David
and Aunt Margaret, and I know Uncle Jimmie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
needs Aunt Gertrude and has always needed her.
Did my going away help those things to their
fruition? I hope so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not bear to think of Aunt Beulah, but I
know that I must bear to think of her, and face
the pain of having hurt her as I must face every
other thing that comes into my life from this
hour. I would give her back Peter, if I could,&mdash;but
I can not. He is mine, and I am his, and we
have been that way from the beginning. I have
thought of him always as stronger and wiser than
any one in the world, but I don&#8217;t think he is. He
has suffered and stumbled along, trying blindly to
do right, hurting Aunt Beulah and mixing up his
life like any man, just the way Uncle Jimmie and
Uncle David did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t men know who it is they love? They
seem so often to be struggling hungrily after the
wrong thing, trying to get, or to make themselves
take, some woman that they do not really want.
When women love it is not like that with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When women love! I think I have loved Peter
from the first minute I saw him, so beautiful and
dear and sweet, with that <i>anxious</i> look in his
eyes,&mdash;that look of consideration for the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
person that is always so much a part of him. He
had it the first night I saw him, when Uncle David
brought me to show me to my foster parents for
the first time. It was the thing I grew up by, and
measured men and their attitude to women by&mdash;just
that look in his eyes, that tender warm look
of consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means a good many things, I think,&mdash;a
gentle generous nature, and a tender chivalrous
heart. It means selflessness. It means being a
good man, and one who <i>protects</i> by sheer unselfish
instinct. I don&#8217;t know how I shall ever heal him
of the hurt he has done Aunt Beulah. Aunt Margaret
tells me that Aunt Beulah&#8217;s experience with
him has been the thing that has made her whole,
that she needed to live through the human cycle
of emotion&mdash;of love and possession and renunciation
before she could be quite real and sound.
This may be true, but it is not the kind of reasoning
for Peter and me to comfort ourselves with.
If a surgeon makes a mistake in cutting that afterwards
does more good than harm, he must not
let that result absolve him from his mistake.
Nothing can efface the mistake itself, and Peter
and I must go on feeling that way about it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I want to write something down about my love
before I close this book to-night. Something that
I can turn to some day and read, or show to my
children when love comes to them. &#8216;This is the
way I felt,&#8217; I want to say to them, &#8216;the first week
of my love&mdash;this is what it meant to me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means being a greater, graver, and more
beautiful person than you ever thought you could
be. It means knowing what you are, and what
you were meant to be all at once, and I think it
means your chance to be purified for the life you
are to live, and the things you are to do in it.
Experience teaches, but I think love forecasts and
points the way, and shows you what you can be.
Even if the light it sheds should grow dim after a
while, the path it has shown you should be clear
to your inner eye forever and ever. Having been
in a great temple is a thing to be better for all
your life.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that the soul and the things of the
soul are everlasting,&mdash;that they have got to be
everlasting if love is like this. Love between two
people is more than the simple fact of their being
drawn together and standing hand in hand. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
the holy truth about the universe. It is the rainbow
of God&#8217;s promise set over the land. There
comes with it the soul&#8217;s certainty of living on and
on through time and space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just my loving Peter and Peter&#8217;s loving me
isn&#8217;t the important thing,&mdash;the important thing is
the way it has started the truth going; my knowing
and understanding mysterious laws that were
sealed to me before; Peter taking my life in his
hands and making it consecrated and true,&mdash;so
true that I will not falter or suffer from any misunderstandings
or mistaken pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means warmth and light and tenderness, our
love does, and all the poetry in the world, and all
the motherliness, (I feel so much like his mother).
Peter is my lover. When I say that he is not
stronger or wiser than any one in the world I
mean&mdash;in living. I mean in the way he behaves
like a little bewildered boy sometimes. In loving
he is stronger and wiser than any living being. He
takes my two hands in his and gives me all the
strength and all the wisdom and virtue there is
in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t written down anything, after all, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
any one could read. My children can&#8217;t look over
my shoulder on to this page, for they would not
understand it. It means nothing to any one in the
world but me. I shall have to translate for them
or I shall have to say to them, &#8216;Children, on looking
into this book, I find I can&#8217;t tell you what
love meant to me, because the words I have put
down would mean nothing to you. They were
only meant to inform me, whenever I should turn
back to them, of the great glory and holiness that
fell upon me like a garment when love came.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if there should be any doubt in my heart
as to the reality of the feeling that has come to
them in their turn, I should only have to turn
their faces up to the light, and look into their
eyes and <i>know</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not die as my own mother did. I know
that. I know that Peter will be by my side until
we both are old. These facts are established in
my consciousness I hardly know how, and I know
that they are there,&mdash;but if such a thing could be
that I should die and leave my little children, I
would not be afraid to leave them alone in a
world that has been so good to me, under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
protection of a Power that provided me with the
best and kindest guardians that a little orphan
ever had. God bless and keep them all, and
